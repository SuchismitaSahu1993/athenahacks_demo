1,gameofthrones,it s confirmed. the iron cair was stolen. currently the night king and the living investigating into this crime.
2,gameofthrones,"Looking at it, I'm thinking the same thing. Nothing makes sense about travel times and battles on the show now. What is life anymore?"
3,gameofthrones,"It's just fun to dress up and see how well you can match the character or put your own spin on it, and also find others that share your love of the show/movie/comic, I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make... Would you be happier if she had a background of westeros or something? Some people do photo shoots with their cosplays, but it's definitely not the main point. It's literally a convention for people to explore and share fandom. "
4,gameofthrones,"I meant the show. The books certainly don't have a large enough audience to sustain this business, as popular as they have been, nor is it their target audience. "
5,gameofthrones,Does it? Says Gigfran.
6,gameofthrones,"Yup, that's why they take months even after shooting is complete."
7,gameofthrones,"> Not to mention she just adopted this new annoying expression of keeping her eyes half open when delivering her quips.

10,gameofthrones,I keep waiting for someone to ask the director or producers about that baby. Was that a real stare? Did they use CGI? Haven't read anything about it yet.
11,gameofthrones,"Paid the iron price for the limb, though. "

29,gameofthrones,Aww... I miss Shireen. She and Davos were so wholesome. 
30,gameofthrones,What's the beef?
31,gameofthrones,Thank you!!
32,gameofthrones,"> Could Ellaria finally get her revenge? Could she request a trial by combat?


lol why would cersei allow that? Tyene is going to be murdered in front of her mama and Ellaria is going to get Mountained like shame nun was/is. "
33,gameofthrones,Yep and ser friendzone in second gear was dying. Bravo OP.

40,gameofthrones,"He would probably be trying to find Stannis if he heard that. And upon finding that that whole family was dead, what then? I don't think he would really think ""oh there was that smuggler and red woman that he hung around all the time. wonder what they're up to"". He would have to sort of coincidentally run into them, recognise them, and connect the dots."
41,gameofthrones,"FWIW, Doran Martell has the gout. Oberon is the badass who gets his skull popped. "
42,gameofthrones,No kidding lol 
43,gameofthrones,"[This version](http://i.imgur.com/IAhmVsy.png) is so much better, especially Pyke.

50,gameofthrones,"Oh no, he looked very pretty. "
51,gameofthrones,"It was an extremely obvious move and not telling her advisors was also dumb. I find it so outstandingly stupid that they would sell an army larger than theirs while it is still inside their walls. If you did not see this coming from a mile/ kilometer away you have the foresight of a snake trying to consume a deer that is 50% larger in body mass. 

Still a badass scene, but it was not some outstandingly clever move and the way she executed it was poor in not telling Jorah/ beristan. "
52,gameofthrones,and even sucks!
53,gameofthrones,The mountains are really cool but I feel like this is the venue for criticism so my criticism is that the dragon (specifically the wings) is a little too symmetrical. 
54,gameofthrones,Her smile is always so infectious. 
55,gameofthrones,"Reyne, Baratheon, Tyrell, Lannister. "

70,gameofthrones,That was in Astapor.
71,gameofthrones,"I'd definitely watch it. Don't think it's available anywhere, but send me a link if you *do* find it"
72,gameofthrones,"Yes!  In fact, Mr. Mom is an American comedy film starring Michael Keaton released in 1983.  This quirky film involves the main character Jack (Keaton), who has just been fired from his job, and his wife (Teri Garr) who decides that she needs to find her own employment to keep the family above water.  The ensuing role-reversal creates a series of fun, family comedy."
73,gameofthrones,Lol was that what that was?
74,gameofthrones,"If it ain't wight, it ain't right."
75,gameofthrones,"She knew little finger people would come to aid in the battle. She keep them hidden till the battle was at the end.

91,gameofthrones,Wow Alex Trebek called the white walkers alliterate? I’m alliterate and I find that offensive.
92,gameofthrones,"I feel like the original was almost definitely based around an initial trace over an actual image of Natalie Dormer, due to an initial lack of confidence of proportions etc. "
93,gameofthrones,You really gotta appreciate Ayra during those first few episodes in her just repeatedly calling out how characters are related for no reason. It’s wonderful with the amount of characters flying around. 
94,gameofthrones,"You're a highborn, I bet you live in a castle."

99,gameofthrones,"She should totally kill him and steal his face, then go on to have a lucrative music career. Wait a second...maybe Arya did this some time ago, and his meteoric rise to stardom is all her doing. "
100,gameofthrones,"I think it isn't as obvious in the show as it is in the books but by the time Sansa falls into Little Finger's hands she has grown a fucking lot, she has more character development than probably all the other starks combined. Her experience in Kings Landing has made her mature in ways that none of her brothers have, she understands the game of thrones, she understands when is the time to kneel, when is the time to make allies, she understands it is important to be kind and remain truth to the Stark spirit but she also understands playing the game by her father's rules will only lead to failure.

Think about it Sansa's teachers were Little Finger, Cersei, Tyrion, and Margaery which are (putting Varys aside) the strongest characters in the series when it comes to playing the game.

Im really looking forward to what they make of her character in the coming episodes"
101,gameofthrones,That's a good guess. Maybe castor was keeping been partially in check for a while but they really are due a greenseer? 
102,gameofthrones,If I looked like Natalie Dormer I would smirk all the time too. 
103,gameofthrones,"Mastercard starts with 5, discover is 6, AMEX starts with 3 and only has 15 digits.

104,gameofthrones,"One does have to wonder what would've happened if Robert had actually tried, though. When in the same breath as her incest, she admitsNed Stark that she loved him, wanted to be married to him- that feels like an authentic look at the point where she turned from one path to the other. 

On a dramatic level, put it this way- her enmity with Robert wouldn't have been half so compelling or motivating if she didn't- at first- love him. She didn't ""turn out"" to be Cersei. She was both made into Cersei, and she had to invent Cersei. She might've been a mean spirited bitch at the outset, but you can trace elements there if you want to- her mother dies, her father basically goes totally cold, she's a bored rich girl who turned out rotten because Tywin failed to smack her up when she was tender. 

But there was a brief period at the end of the war where things might've gone differently. "
105,gameofthrones,"Cersie smirks...

""The mother of dragons has lost her children""

Danny smiles and stares at the iron throne...

""My children conquered westeros. Your children died watching their kingdom burn from a throne.""

106,gameofthrones,"It's called ribbing. It's something we humans sometimes do. Also known as, ""poking fun"" or ""making a joke"". 

I see Elon hasn't programmed that into you cyborgs yet. I'm sure it's coming. "
107,gameofthrones,"Ironically, he died similar to how his father did.

There's no loyalty in a starved dog.  That's all Roose saw Ramsey as anyway."
108,gameofthrones,"People into fantasy knew him well before the show. Sanderson once talked about how when he was trying to get published the publishers would say they didn't want his weird worlds, they wanted very realistic barely magical worlds like George's. He was already so big that the publishers demanded others do it like him."
109,gameofthrones,Why would the Kingsguard be guarding a woman carrying a Baratheon bastard?
110,gameofthrones,"It was love at first sight. 

And the cave scene was already teetering past political thanks to the sexual tension. "

116,gameofthrones,"Its her same dress, https://i.imgur.com/3paNsIU.jpg. "
117,gameofthrones,"That makes sense, but I have trouble understanding how things like that are done in peaceful times. Like when Ned tells Bran that he and Rickon will be Robb's bannermen one day and have their own keeps. Are there just empty castles and unoccupied lands sitting around, or would they carve out some land from someone's territory and build a new castle there?"
118,gameofthrones,Yes. He's his nephew. Where ya been?
119,gameofthrones,"Yea, it's quick, but I could make out at least 3 people/wights behind her. "
120,gameofthrones,"I had lots of apathy too and us dads love embarrassing our daughters in public places most of all I think.  It is one of our greatest joys. 

Edit: as soon as I hit send I though I should have called it vigorous apathy which I am not sure can technically exist but it would make a great college band name.  "

123,gameofthrones,Somehow this makes an insane amount of sense.
124,gameofthrones,"I think that you got the entire Littlefinger plot figured out, but there's one minor problem: That wasn't Alys Karstark he was speaking to. The actor who plays Alys is a ginger, that woman was blonde. She was likely just a handmaid. "
125,gameofthrones,"Nah dude, his hand definitely don't hurt no more."
126,gameofthrones,She delivered one of the most powerful lines of the episode LIKE IT WAS HER FUCKING JOB. Holy shit it was amazing.

131,gameofthrones,"Not to mention Sam says : 
“I wonder if we’ll ever be put into songs or tails... “I wonder if people will ever say, 'Let's hear about Jon and the Night's Watch' And they'll say 'Yes, that's one of my favorite stories. Jon was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?' 'Yes, my boy, the most famousest of northern folk. And that's saying a lot.”"

136,gameofthrones,Yeah the vision with both of them is definitely also in the books. 
137,gameofthrones,"Gorgeous.
"
138,gameofthrones,"Yes... which is why Stannis offered to *make* Renly his heir. 

As an uncle, Renly would not be king upon Stannis' death. As a legally named heir, power would pass to Renly instead of Shireen. "
139,gameofthrones,"Thanks for that? I've legit never watched, and only looked this up after I posted. "

146,gameofthrones,"I imagine they might be done with the Snakes by then. Who knows... Maybe they'll introduce Arianne Martell next season? Like, she'd been on holiday or Doran had her exiled and the Snakes thought she was dead.

Or there is just infighting between the Snakes and they become a liability to themselves and Tyrion ends their squabbling in order to appoint new rulers for Dorne."
147,gameofthrones,"A lot of the characters are a lot older in the tv show, because it would just be kinda ridiculous if Dany and Jon would be very young children. But in the books they are, yes. "

152,gameofthrones,It would be hilarious though 
153,gameofthrones,"> there’s a difference between a piece of art being put out for interpretation and the creator of said art intending something and someone completely making up their own message for it lmao 

What difference is that? Do you think the interpretation isn't reasonable? It's not ""completely making something up"" since the elements of the scene that apply to the metaphor are clearly pointed out in the article."
154,gameofthrones,"Damn gotta rewatch, is there a good refresher for it? "
155,gameofthrones,You are simply talented.
156,gameofthrones,"Yep, it was 100% a ploy. A bit reminiscent of the one he used to find Cersei's mole in the small council. "

167,gameofthrones,"Yeah but Yara and Theon made it all the way on the other side of the world in one episode, so I don't think 100+ miles is too far."
168,gameofthrones,"Except Ned was played by Sean Bean, so we had some clue he'd probably die."

172,gameofthrones,"Freys hold the Twins, location which is very important location for a variety of reasons. Also, Freys are a wealthy house with suffiecient manpower and political influence. 

 Power in Westeros is all about strong alliances. Its definitely not only PR reasons and especially since the Lannisters have pretty much lost all their former allies "
173,gameofthrones,"Haha ""Like oh my God I'm like totally gonna marry this Joffrey fer shuure""."

188,gameofthrones,"You're probably right, i didn't see ""fire and blood"" on the targaryen sigil so maybe they think everyone will know the dragon but nothing else. Which is stupid, but possible. 

Edit: i looked on Amazon and [this set]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0784WHLY6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_BCunAbVZ09PZ8) has fire and blood on the dragon, but they also function as hair pins, which is cool i guess. "

So since it's gonna happen no matter what, store owners have been known to reach out to good local artists and offer them their garage space for a chance to put up their art. The store owner will pay for the materials, but not pay the artist so the artist will essentially do it for free. The store owner gets a good looking door that they will enjoy themselves and get free marketing with a good looking door that people will notice outside their operating hours.

The best artists and the best looking spots won't get tagged over because that would be awful to have. But after a while, normal doors get tagged more than a few times and start to look like a street art collage.

The neighborhoods of La Rivera and El Raval are amazing spots for all types of street art but the garages get tagged all over the city. As long as it's not unsightly or inappropriate, it's usually gonna stay up. The Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen doors are done in Gracia so I'm assuming this one is too. 

Backstory: after Francisco Franco's fascist regime dissipated in the 70's, culture returned to Catalunya in a big way. Franco refused to recognize their native language, Catalan (as well as Basque and Galician in other parts of the country) and they were losing their voice as a unique region. So singing, music, and art were alive and well in Barcelona again and everyone wanted it to stay that way. Oppressing the creatives and the uniques is something Barcelona is never going to do because it's what Franco did to them so art is a bit of a haven here.

Source: living in Barcelona and have gone on street art tours and studied it for fun. "

If I like a GoT character, it means they'll probably die by the end of the season

If I hate a GoT character, it means they'll probably be enjoying triumph upon triumph for 3+ seasons after which they'll either be killed or turned into a good / ambiguous character.

EDIT: Not a shot at show watchers. I'm just saying, based on the medium, show watchers are more likely to be casual consumers. Anyone who has read and watched knows they pull shit like this all the time."
242,gameofthrones,Could someone tell me who the woman/character standing between Brienne and Tywin Lannister is? I can't for the life of me figure out who she is. TIA.
243,gameofthrones,Yeah I never finished the series because it got progressively worse after the second season. I'm still disappointed about it honestly
244,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I'm colorblind. Occasionally someone makes fun of me for incorrectly identifying a color. Sometimes, I have a hard time in certain video games. Other than that it is really not an issue."
245,gameofthrones,"I don't understand why so many people have a problem with the Braavos scenes.  They were *supposed* to feel repetitive and time-consuming.   She was becoming an assassin for fuck's sake, while also waging an internal struggle between avenging Arya Stark and becoming No One.  Before she went to Braavos, she was just a little girl who threw tantrums, stabbed people, and had to be constantly rescued by someone else.

Did you want her to just spend a long weekend with Yoda on Dagobah while Han and the gang cruised the galaxy?  For Arya's transformation to be believable, the audience needed to feel that a lot of time had passed."

247,gameofthrones,"Link is down, too bad i would have considered purchasing this cause awe..wait for it...some !"
248,gameofthrones,"That's why i think the show made a mistake on not showing Jon truly like he is in the books. He is politically intelligent, sassy, assertive, observant, has good strategic mind (which Stannis employed in ADWD) and generally lot smarter than the show counterpart. If you read the books its easier to see why he could be a good king but he needs to work on his communication skills. If only the show put more focus on those aspects of Jon then it would be easier to see why he deserves to be king."
249,gameofthrones,"My guess is that in Astapor see was showing off her High Valyrian and put on a Valyrian accent to emphasise how good her Valyrian is. Whereas in the later seasons she uses a Westerosi accent because that's what she's most comfortable with, even though she's a Valyrian her native accent is still Westerosi. At least I think it's supposed to be. She hadn't set foot in Westeros until she was already an adult, so does she have a Pentosi accent?"

294,gameofthrones,"Littlefinger was raised as a part of the same household of Cat and Lysa. He fell in love with Cat, and Lysa fell in love with him. He took Lysa’s virginity as a sort of consolation prize since Cat never noticed him, Lysa got pregnant, and refused to abort the child of the man she loved. Lord Tully forced Lysa to abort the child by poisoning it out, and it worked, but kept her from having kids for a long time. I don’t think anyone besides the Blackfish knew it was Littlefinger’s child, but he kept his silence to protect them I guess, maybe Lysa convinced him? Anyways, there’s speculation that Robin Arryn is Littlefinger’s bastard, which is part of the reason Lysa babies him since it’s the only part of Littlefinger she had for a long time, the other part being that the poison stopped her from conceiving for years.

A Song of Ice and Fire is his magnum opus, a story he has been meticulously crafting for over 20 years, there's over 2000 named characters, over 24 POV characters, dozens of plot lines happening at the same time, shit's complicated ok?
And for a story so big and ambitious to not have any glaring plot holes is an amazing feat in it of itself. GRRM is a logical writer, he has his characters suffer realistic consequences for their actions, he doesn't go ""hurr durr, Jon is the messiah who will save the world and get the girl and be king and it'll be awesomeeee"", like the show. There's nuance, intrigue and hundreds of moving parts, which unfortunately for us takes a long ass time to craft and hopefully they will be finished.

441,gameofthrones,The Avatar beach episode was pretty good. 
442,gameofthrones,"This is why we can't have nice things.

Wrap it up boys, the PC police is here."
443,gameofthrones,"Unfortunately, blue and orange almost always make an icky brown..."
444,gameofthrones,I really hope he ends up alive. He deserves some happiness. He's the best.
445,gameofthrones,"It usually needs quite a bit of cleaning up, but isn't unusable. I'm much better manipulating music on paper than actually with an instrument so it works okay for me personally."
446,gameofthrones,All those previous magazine covers and photo shoots are starting to actually mean something. Haha. They've been in promo shoots together for a long time yet it took until season 7 for them to be in the same frame on the show. It finally happened.
447,gameofthrones,Which one?
448,gameofthrones,"""*How are we losing this war*"""
449,gameofthrones,[deleted]
450,gameofthrones,"Year 1: Bang nephew
Year 2: Stop Night King
Year 3: Break Wheel
Year 4: ???
Year 5: Profit"
451,gameofthrones,"Technically, he was by Mrs. Clegane with supplemental materials provided by Mr. Clegane."
452,gameofthrones,Are you effing kidding me? Why not just hire him?
453,gameofthrones,"""You were so magnificent when you watched your brother die"""
454,gameofthrones,"""Oh, for the... Just give me a rest!"""
455,gameofthrones,"> not you. ffs we don't want you menstruating all over the books

I died."
456,gameofthrones,"Whoa now, he was pretty hot in the [Red Nose Day skit](https://youtu.be/zs7xO5P3Az4?t=5m53s).  I'm 100% straight but I totally would have sucked his dick."
457,gameofthrones,mm yeah but in that case what does it being an i.redd.it link have to do with it?
458,gameofthrones,[deleted]
459,gameofthrones,"I wasn't super surprised by her reaction to Shireen's burning. Even Mel, who was the instigator of the sacrifice and pushed it all the way through the season, was visibly jaded after the fact. Mel's reaction might have been more about how she was realizing she was wrong about Stannis being the Prince.

Makes you wonder how warped Stannis' mind was after all he had been through to react the way he did to Shireen's sacrifice, though."
460,gameofthrones,Did. You did the tour.
461,gameofthrones,Amazing 
462,gameofthrones,Why did you write the exact name and number of the episode? 
463,gameofthrones,How have I not seen this
464,gameofthrones,This is perfect. Noting for future reference. 
465,gameofthrones,"That's what made him such a better Daario, not the teeth part but he smirk and his overall manner was such much more Daario."
466,gameofthrones,I thought I was about to watch a trailor for the next episode.. this is so much better
467,gameofthrones,"Dragon seems like a pretty cool guy, burns people and doesn't afraid of anything."
468,gameofthrones,"Saw the caption and immediately thought ""CRIPPLE FIGHT"" from South Park. "
469,gameofthrones,Get dehyped it's probably not this season :(
470,gameofthrones,The line is legally extinct.
471,gameofthrones,Very well done however Margary wins by cleavage.
472,gameofthrones,My only criticism as well. She looks like a Lanister here with that golden blonde hair. 
473,gameofthrones,I honestly believe that this fight has the best choreography that I have ever seen. I have watched this scene a dozen times and it is still amazing to me. 
474,gameofthrones,Amazing. Those fingers look so real.
475,gameofthrones,"Transportation really has improved a lot in Westeros. It's like looking at a motorola razor on the display of your smartphone and thinking: *How the hell were people able to work with that?!*

End of the season we'll have Jon sitting in Braavos with Tyrion for a weekend trip talking about the good old time where travel took months over a nice cup of wine."
476,gameofthrones,"Well, every season had a high point anyway, even if many other points were quite low."
477,gameofthrones,"Oh my goodness, everything about that Jon and Sansa interaction is so perfect. I went to pick a favorite from that section and can't! ""I...I don't understand what's happening""...""so glad that joke was resurrected with the rest of me""...and ""don't break another oath so soon"" were all gold, and that's just to name a few from just that little section!"
478,gameofthrones,I want to be your apprentice.
479,gameofthrones,I'm looking forward to the possible Bran and Jaime reunion now.
480,gameofthrones,"On my chest like a shirt, damn you sir are thinking smart "
481,gameofthrones,"But it's not very realistic because the head of the Queensguard, the greatest warrior in the Seven Kingdoms, the man who ended the Defiance of Duskendale, was dumb enough to wander around an occupied city without his armour or shield or anything more than a minimal bodyguard, and got stabbed like a chump."
482,gameofthrones,Oh hi mark!
483,gameofthrones,Holy shit she aged 20 years!! That make up team knows how to make up.
484,gameofthrones,"It's treason, then."
485,gameofthrones,It is! 
486,gameofthrones,"Exactly...
Well, some cities do it for the tourists, but most tourists in Europe come from... Europe...
They don't care about feeling medieval for Americans, most Americans don't even know what medieval feels like.
Hint: not like a Hollywood movie. The American thing I've seen that looks the closes to what medieval feels like is indeed GoT and look how many Europeans are involved."
487,gameofthrones,It wasn't completed until season 7.
488,gameofthrones,"Not to mention it's past the books, so we have no idea what the fuck will happen. The last ten minutes gave me a heart attack."
489,gameofthrones,Goddamn that's clever. The production design on this show is god tier. 
490,gameofthrones,This looked less like a table and more like a carpet 
491,gameofthrones,"Glad im not the only one. I was completely panicking. I remember thinking ""this is exactly how george Martin would kill a supposed hero"" and was losing my mind bc of that line of thought"
492,gameofthrones,But is the world fireproof?
493,gameofthrones,Could be in season 8. I imagine everyone will be running south at that point.
494,gameofthrones,that shot where the guy on the horse almost kills him from behind but gets taken down before jon even knows he's coming was incredible
495,gameofthrones,This gif is REALLY high-quality. Holy cow.
496,gameofthrones,"I though she had a condition where the iris was translucent, so the red reflection of the rear of the eye tinted the blue towards purple"
497,gameofthrones,"He is constantly underestimated as a tottering old man, when really he is faking it.  He wants to fly under the radar and since no one took him seriously he was able to for quite some time.  He was grand maester during the Mad King's rule.  He stuck around for long time after that considering all the political turmoil that happened."
498,gameofthrones,She looks like a mix between Sansa and aria 
499,gameofthrones,"Not ""THE"" Iron Throne.
The one shown in GOT isn't labeled with ""Game of Thrones"" below your feet"

501,gameofthrones,Fucking hope so.
502,gameofthrones,People take this shit way too far
503,gameofthrones,Isnt it clearly winter there? 
504,gameofthrones,"Why are people saying that ? If it's a loop, it's not like he can do anything about it. Hodor would always be Hodor."
505,gameofthrones,^fuck ^Olly
506,gameofthrones,I love that middle row.  I went out of my way to buy those editions second hand rather than the new ones at the top.
507,gameofthrones,"We'll figure out the details on the plane, first we need to get to Scotland! I know a guy who knows a guy who's got a castle and is REALLY good at ruining weddings"
508,gameofthrones,"As pointed out the last time it was posted, check out Cersei’s and Jaimes eyes."
509,gameofthrones,"Same. Good low fantasy is a difficult thing to find. The closest thing I can think of that I've read is the Gentleman Bastard Sequence, but even that has the bondsmagi and starts getting excessively magicky in book 3."
510,gameofthrones,"Idk, but if that was the case I'm sure tee fury would've been shut down years ago"
511,gameofthrones,"Even if they had let her through, would she still have been able to make it far enough away from the blast radius in time?"
512,gameofthrones,How so?  I never really considered its impact on high lattitude countries.
513,gameofthrones,Who is holding Storm's End and all of the Baratheon Land?
514,gameofthrones,Because Daenerys would crush her?
515,gameofthrones,Jaime the golden boy should have won though or Theon the guy with huge balls but with no penis
516,gameofthrones,"Nah man, the tanks should have rolled in from the side and just run over the entire line. /s"

529,gameofthrones,"I think it's great and clever to go with color associations and broader idea associations, like that one maple leaf flag for what I'm assuming is winterfell. "
530,gameofthrones,Didn't Sansa kind of ask that and Bran just replied about her wedding night?
531,gameofthrones,Brans chapters are significantly more interesting than the grand majority of Sam's imo. Or Brienne's *shudder*
532,gameofthrones,The whole season's been building up to it...can't wait for Gendry's appearance in the finale
533,gameofthrones,Y'all sound like Jorah Mormont.
534,gameofthrones,But not Ser Jorah
535,gameofthrones,It's... It's... Uncanny! 
536,gameofthrones,One of them was a captain and the other two worked at different ships. Daven survived and was Stannis' squire and he has even younger children (2 I think) still living with Lady Marya
537,gameofthrones,Thank you kindly!
538,gameofthrones,And leave through the moon door
539,gameofthrones,Wight Hodor is Azor Ahai.
540,gameofthrones,">especially since he didn't get noticeably better in 1v1 combat. 


I feel like it's fair to chalk that up to ""just fucked up 3 other dudes plus diabled Howland all while wearing full armor, gotta be running low on gas""

543,gameofthrones,"It doesn't make sense that he would bring the honeycomb because he grew tired of the donkey either. 

He says he brought the honeycomb for the same reason he brought the donkey--which he stated is because he has grown tired of the donkey and it's been a long time since he felt a woman's touch. It's poor sentence construction and poor joke construction. "
544,gameofthrones,1 delivery delayed = collapse of entire country 
545,gameofthrones,For now. Bear Island is famous for producing Briennesque women.
546,gameofthrones,"I heard that guy had, like, *30 goddam dicks*"
547,gameofthrones,Holy handless hotness that's fucking awesome.
548,gameofthrones,They all gonna die.
549,gameofthrones,How long can you be away from your family before it's considered giving it up?
550,gameofthrones,Haha yes
551,gameofthrones,Unless she's attracted to him more because of it in which case... more bad luck Bear? At least he has a cool cousin who's lady of Bear Island.
552,gameofthrones,No wonder Phasma gives off so many badass vibes. 
553,gameofthrones,You had me at Alfred. I just died ahahahaha
554,gameofthrones,"I always try to play, but I get lost in the sheer size, and objective. I can never figure out who to fight, who to subvert or make claims on etc. So much info to look through too."
555,gameofthrones,There are 22 separate mentions in the novels of Stannis grinding his teeth.
556,gameofthrones,I was thinking he's right out of Peaky Blinders
557,gameofthrones,Season 5 was better
558,gameofthrones,"Watch Skins UK my man, you're welcome. Probably not the  first to comment this to you."
559,gameofthrones,"In the books it's 300, but in the show each season lasts roughly a year, so it's currently 305 AC in the show."

562,gameofthrones,Fewer*
563,gameofthrones,What did they wantin the book for season 1?
564,gameofthrones,Wait how is this a spoiler?
565,gameofthrones,"Kind of an ignorant ego-stroking one dimensional wank, aren't you?"
566,gameofthrones,In LoTR they weren't cgi.
567,gameofthrones,For whom the bell crushes
568,gameofthrones,It was a good throwaway line from Tyrion but it's been way overused
569,gameofthrones,Best hour of TV I've ever seen. The first 13 minutes in Meereen were awesome too.
570,gameofthrones,But it's important what that standard time is. Most anti dst people want to go back to standard time and standard time blows.
571,gameofthrones,"Reminds me of a Black mirror episode.

The black mirror episode he was in was the first time I saw the troll face in a longgg time"
572,gameofthrones,What it made of? 
573,gameofthrones,Jon's is like his departure from the watch to king in the north with house stark having a grey sigil. Red/gold of Lannister to black/green of mad queen (wildfire is green) and Dany of course from essos queen to targaryen 
574,gameofthrones,"Lmao.  That would be the weirdest way to end this series, including showing the Battlestar Galactica in some cave somewhere."
575,gameofthrones,"I just want a scene when, in battle, we hear Ghost howl to the sky, then after 10 seconds, a second howl, and another, and soon enough to create a breeze from the forests. "
576,gameofthrones,"All over Europe, too. Probably not for the same reason you gave, though. "
577,gameofthrones,Mike Tython
578,gameofthrones,lmaoooooo
579,gameofthrones,"Kind of like how Tyrion told Oberyn ""At least wear a helmet!"" before the trial by combat, and we saw how that ended
"
580,gameofthrones,myrish swamp
581,gameofthrones,"They're vassals of the Glovers, in case you were still wondering"
582,gameofthrones,"Bloodraven was half Blackwood. House Blackwood claims descent from ancient northern kings before the starks ruled over the entire north. 

I can't remember the name of the northern house and king they claim descent from, so let's call them proto-Blackwoods. (I think they were called the ""Warg Kings"") The Stark kings at one point start expanding their borders and start to conquer the north, which includes the Red Kings (Boltons). House Stark now has their eye on the proto-Blackwoods, and go to war. Starks win, kill the king and take one of the King's daughters to wed. Some speculate this is where the Starks get their warging powers from.

Now as for the remainder of the Warg-King/proto-blackwoods, it is said they fled south to the riverlands and became House Blackwood.

So you are right, there is something special about the first men. Bloodraven didn't Warg due to being Targaryen, he is able to Warg thanks to his mother's side - House Blackwood.

All this info I read from the book A World of Ice and Fire. It's been awhile since I read it though, so sorry I don't have better info. "

There are only so many times Yara can forgive Theon"
587,gameofthrones,"Not painful, but those contacts tend to be really fucking uncomfortable."
588,gameofthrones,Where did you get the costume? I didn't realize they made them so realistic
589,gameofthrones,This might be the dumbest tinfoil theory I've seen in this sub yet 
590,gameofthrones,"Here in Finland, back in the 50's and 60's they used to drink coffee with butter and salt.

Not even kidding."
591,gameofthrones,"It isn't about the quantity, it's about the quality. 

Ned was shocking because so much character development had been invested in him, and so much of the plot ran through him. When such characters are in trouble, you expect them to Deus Ex Machina their way out of it and survive till the end. Similarly Robb and Grey Wind. 

Compare this to Freys and Boltons. They may be central to advancing the plot in some way, but you haven't seen their full development, or fought their moral battles with them, so you don't empathize with them. What we see of them is outright villainy, and you expect them to die violently. 

We've also seen auxiliary characters die off (Rickon, Olenna, Lannister kids), but what truly set GoT/ASOIAF apart was the complete lack of plot armor. Any supposed protagonist could die completely randomly. 

The last *main* character to die was probably Hodor, and before that, Stannis. 

What also adds to the feeling that it isn't like before is the (lack of) chilling finality of death. Earlier, characters who died stayed dead. Now many protagonists are coming back from death or near death, much like a traditional story: Jon, Cleganes, Jorah, and I suspect that in next week's episode, Bronn and Jaime. I mean, Seven Hells, Arya even got back her eyesight. In a supposedly cruel world which doesn't care if you're good or evil, that seems strangely... forgiving. "
592,gameofthrones,"After rewatching several scenes from the first/second season, I had forgotten how much flak Cersei got for allowing Joffrey to kill Ned Stark. Even the scene of his execution, you see her flipping out. Kind of a far cry from what she's now become."
593,gameofthrones,"He's a fictional character from a fictional place - accents really aren't that important as long as they're consistent.

Both Tyrion and Jaime speak with a very similar accent - intentional or not, its a detail I really appreciate. "
594,gameofthrones,"Try a test with some public domain stuff. Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz, The Wind in the Willows would be amazing. "
595,gameofthrones,"HAPPY NAME DAY to King Martin!First of his name,King of the Andals and the First Men,Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,and Protector of the Realm."

597,gameofthrones,"It's a term meaning you want two characters to be in a relationship. So you ""ship"" two people. "
598,gameofthrones,"Gran is the real MVP!!! This is amazing and beautiful. Such detail makes it seem like it would have taken longer than a year. Hats off to you, Gran! Awesome job!"
599,gameofthrones,Ah okay. That makes sense. It is a cool symbol 
600,gameofthrones,I loved how it combined the Greyjoy and Targaryen motifs
601,gameofthrones,Seems like they are heavily suggesting that these three characters will die. Or perhaps it's just supposed to be symbolism for them defending their own lives?
602,gameofthrones,I love Maisie
603,gameofthrones,"Nor me.  Although very occasionally we can see the Northern Lights.  This photo is cool as fuck, get it framed and up on the wall lass."

605,gameofthrones,He had plans with viserys(SP?) and I thought he was aware of the mummers dragon as well.
606,gameofthrones,"Faaaak, i havent seen this but the Picture is amazing"
607,gameofthrones,In the original plot outline GRRM submitted it was Jon and Arya.
608,gameofthrones,"It's indicated in the books dragons don't go out of there way to hunt people (they can get in the way and sometimes they'll eat them when they are there). There used to be several on Dragonstone but they stuck to sheep. As long as Daenerys keeps her dragons fed in the show, there wouldn't be any issues. "
609,gameofthrones,Who's Noone?
610,gameofthrones,"The previews make my longing for the next episode worse. I've learned to be happy with the episode. If I watch the preview, I have a blood curdling need to see more. "
611,gameofthrones,And each location it shines light on are the areas that are being covered in that episode. It's never the same places every time
612,gameofthrones,I think it's funny how LOL means nothing so we need to spell out something else to convince people we actually laughed.
613,gameofthrones,"It's not really his fault. In fact that's a major point the books try to make, that: 1. the road to hell is paved with good intentions and 2. it's harder than you think to know what the right thing is AND do it. 

You can't always trust your own perspective. You should always question your understanding of things. 

Boromir was a good man -- just like Isildur was. 

Think of the ring like a mental illness, or a perspective filter. It doesn't matter how good you are if your understanding of reality is messed up. "

631,gameofthrones,"Yup, it was Osha time really, they liked her acting so much they added more scenes."
632,gameofthrones,"Yes, even if you're just going to plagiarize quotes in a basic design. It's not art so you're gonna need speed and volume to compete with the other machines on etsy."
633,gameofthrones,"There is still a little doubt if the skull they sent was in fact the Mountains. Despite being a very large skull Cersei and Qyburn went through the effort to completely strip it to the bone with beetles, and even Obara questions why they would do that. I'd think it'd be easier to get a large skull than raise someone from the dead without a head, but magic sure is a funny thing. "
634,gameofthrones,Thanks! I've listed them on ebay and I'm going to start making them right away. http://www.ebay.com/itm/112034264277

636,gameofthrones,Dope! But seems rather impractical for pockets (if it fits!)
637,gameofthrones,"Yah part of why I think GRRM is a very good author, even if his books sometimes feel like reading the bible :P. He turned multiple stories in to one story and made us reconsider our perspectives along the way. "

642,gameofthrones,"Damn, is his voice really that low? "

662,gameofthrones,I don’t think anyone got to choose their lords. I don’t think that’s how it worked. Unless Brienne was a special case. I can’t remember. An “honorable” knight was dedicated to his/her lord despite his character. This has always been a huge problem throughout history lol. Honorable knights with shitty bosses.

697,gameofthrones,"I was thinking the same thing. And I remember them being more accurate when they were younger. But now that they're older the show has given them all a thick layer of black over everything. So much that to me they're all identical from a distance. But in reality, if I remember correctly, Drogon is the typical edgelord Black and Red (so accurate), Viserion is Cream and White, and Rhaegal is Green with gold accents I think. But on TV this season, to me, they just all look black with their colors faintly visible in the fins"

715,gameofthrones,"My wife and I just finished season 7 for the second time after having watched the previous 6 seasons at least 4 times all the way through. Season 7 left a bitter taste in our mouths due to the accelerated pace, the force-feeding aspect of it. I will say we enjoyed S7 much more this time around, possibly due to the impending eighth season around a month away, but still got pissed off by things like: 

* -Why didn't all of the wights die during the capture mission when Jon killed the commanding White Walker?
* -Why would the Night King not aim at Drogon (all aboard!) first and instead take out Viseryon?
* -Is Viseryon breathing fire, or ice?

Minor annoyances admittedly but we both had a couple of immersion breaking moments that really hadn't happened up until S7.

That being said...by the old gods and the new this is one of my favorite television series to air, ever. So well done throughout, excellent world building. We spent at least an hour yesterday diving into the history of the Children and the creation of the Night King, and his (?) true identity. Not many other universes other than Star Wars that I've enjoyed exploring so much. LOVE IT."

732,gameofthrones,"I agree, in the end Dany definitely didn't want him to kneel anymore. She respects him and treats him as an equal. She also values his advice and she's vulnerable around him. 

I wonder if anyone is going to point out the obvious and suggest marriage. Episode 7 would be a nice time to do it, since we probably won't have time for it in season 8.

They have discipline. We fight in the fashion of the Old Empire, yes. They are the lockstep legions of Old Ghis come again, absolutely obedient, absolutely loyal, and utterly without fear.""

Basically, the pick the children that already have some muscle on them, put them through hell, and see who survives. Then they have to keep working out a lot, every day, to simple keep their muscles, and they have skill and discipline. They aren't really the best, that's just good marketing at the Astapori's part.

2. He turned that one pretty easily and he's turned giants so I don't see why it would be that much harder for Drogon. Logically wouldn't you want the biggest one. If he had killed drogon there, there would have been no need to pull him from under the ice as he wasn't in the air, he was standing on the rock.

3. There's nothing so far to back this up and why would he have more ""potential"" to grow bigger? Drogon has always been the strongest and biggest.

The problem is that it doesn't have the level of detail, which makes it slightly less amazing. I still think it's great compared to most shows, though. If the show was a fantasy movie, we'd be in the last 20 or 30 minutes. 

I'm not too worried. I think I'll be satisfied. This happens a LOT with shows that go past a 5th or so season. They misstep, people get mad, then they close it in a decent way."
866,gameofthrones,"The point a lot of people have against Dany isn't her executing captives.

It's the fact she chose to kill them by Dragonfire (Which she was the only one to mention) when others suggested beheading. This in itself would be bad but acceptable, if not for the fact that a rebelion was started against her father for burning her new bestie's Grandfather and Uncle in front of an audience, which was uncalled for by her own admission."

871,gameofthrones,"Yeah, this is great! If only the attention to detail extended to how fast a raven can fly from one end of Westeros to the other... or how long it'd take a dragon to fly the distance... or how hard it'd be to swim up stream in a suit of armor.... or-"
872,gameofthrones,"Yeah this is exactly the point of what he did. All three options were smart, he just wanted to oust the one who was one of Cersei’s “little birds” so to speak "
873,gameofthrones,Catelyn killed that girl at the red wedding though
874,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I guess it's semantics but Theon was ""given"" to the Starks as a show a fealty after the Pyke Rebellion was put down, if I remember correctly.

That surely can't be a positive experience for a young boy to be so easily exchanged for a Throne. "

There wasn't really much they could do when they were being encircled by the soldiers with shields and pikes, they might have killed a couple but it would have happened anyway.

Also, shooting Wun Wun just fits Ramsay's character. He likes to toy with people, and he had all the confidence in the world that he could kill Jon ""one-on-one"" once he gave himself an unfair advantage of distance and a bow. He didn't expect Jon to suddenly grab a shield and block 3 shots."

That's exactly what I've been doing the past month or two and it's been very helpful. When season 6 started I realized I had some knowledge gaps and needed a refresher. 

The second watch is actually much better than the first because you know who's development is most important thus allowing you focus on details you might have otherwise disregarded. "

947,gameofthrones,"One of these moments that was not re-creatable in the show but was awesome in the books ... 

&#x200B;

The last time you see Theon is the sack of Winterfell by Ramsay. You don't hear about him for 1 or 2 books. Then a new character appears in book 5 named 'Reek'. You read from the perspective of this character for a few dozen pages, and only at the end of one of his chapters does he say  something along the lines of 'My old name.. Theon'.

Oberyn, if anyone, cheated in the trial by coating his spear with poison. And Oberyn had the fight won, if he had taken it seriously, and not taunted the mountain. 

Ellaria, and her children, all conspired to kill Myrcella, to avenge something that didn't deserve avenging. 

Does she deserve to spend the rest of her life watching her dead child's body rot, no. but they certainly both deserve death in the confines of the Westero's legal system."

979,gameofthrones,"I really just can't keep interest with Dany anymore, her storyline is so forced and contrived. She's forced into perspective as the hero time and time again with little to no context within the world. Why is it that nobody exists on the opposite side within Essos that can foil her character and make it interesting to watch? Jon Snow has enemies all over Westeros who we can understand and empathize, as much as we may hate them they all have reasons for their doing what they do, and we're shown this in the damn show. Dany however, has no developed character that opposes her in all of her storylines. Hers is the only section that lacks a 'shade of grey' approach, its entirely black and white. Everybody who opposes her is evil straight up no contest. Why is this? Why? How can you have great opposing developed characters like Jamie and Jon, or even Cersei and Arya or Sansa, but then set up Dany unopposed and morally unchallenged by anyone just to force her heroine portrayal? Why must the show INSIST she has to win, that we HAVE to root for her? I simply don't understand why the writing falls so short in only her storylines, when it triumphs so beautifully elsewhere. "
980,gameofthrones,Sansa’s one of my favourites and probably the most relatable 
981,gameofthrones,"She's not being left with much of a choice, the only other available option would be to find another Stark willing to claim The North's independence and get the majority of The North willing to fall in line and fight for it despite the army of the dead coming to steamroll everything in its path.

Dany's actions had little to do with what I was talking about though.  Jorah disgraced his family because he was participating in the slave trade and has more than made amends for it by spending the last handful of years fighting to dismantle the slave trade altogether.  I can't imagine a more appropriate atonement."

Hannibal had his own brother's severed head thrown at him when he was in a shit position. Hannibal who's father also died at the hand of the Romans. But he didn't throw what remained of his army at Rome. 

That's the standard I think we should hold Jon too. Especially given the world he lives in & military tasks ahead of him. Sansa knew this, and that's why she told Jon that Rickon was basically dead already & to not do what Ramsey wants him to do.

Oh, and another example, when Ned was both held & then executed at Kings Landing by the Lannisters, through-out the course of both instances, Rob didn't lose his cool in battle to try to kill either Jamie or Tywin in a suicidal charge, or attempt a mad dash for the Capital to kill Joffery & Cersei."

Bronn at the battle fighting against a dragon should’ve warranted his death or at least some type of consequence. Should Bronn die, it would not only catch u by surprise cause he’s been pretty much covered in plot thick armor the whole series since defending Tyrion in trial. I’ll link a video if ur interested in hearing someone more proficient in explaining

Very nit picky but there are some valid points "
1054,gameofthrones,lol ok you wait for your republic in Westeros.

1056,gameofthrones,CODA is canon
1057,gameofthrones,FADE THEIR FLAIR. 
1058,gameofthrones,how does it feel to win the internet?
1059,gameofthrones,"I don't think we were necessarily seeing Bran warging into Hodor. I think we were seeing Hodor regaining his mind. Something like warging, but not quite. When Bran wargs into someone he sees through their eyes. Yet we can see Bran watching young Hodor."
1060,gameofthrones,Only possible resolution tbh
1061,gameofthrones,Beautiful
1062,gameofthrones,This reminds me of The Secret Show's Changed Daily.
1063,gameofthrones,The Ramseys'zzzeees send their regards
1064,gameofthrones,"Love how long your style is. Gives him a really cool profile!!
I've been finding really exaggerated long styles to be extremely lovely, so please keep it up!"
1065,gameofthrones,The trick is to watch My Finale Part 1 and then start the series over. 
1066,gameofthrones,"The Myrcella thing...She was killed in retribution for Oberyn's death.  Oberyn *chose* to be Tyrion's champion, on account of the whole revenge thing.  But why was it even an option in the first place?  Tywin.  And Cersei, really.  She accused Tyrion of Joffrey's death from the get-go.  He really had no blame in her death.  Just my opinion, and I get Cersei's twisted logic, but if she's going to blame anyone (other than herself) it should be dear old dad. "
1067,gameofthrones,"Eurons marriage would also be political and considering the state of Cersei's armies, not like she has any other options. It really isn't that different if you think about it. "
1068,gameofthrones,You mean the dragon wasn't real?
1069,gameofthrones,By Winter

1071,gameofthrones,He’s got a little too much Blue Steel going on there...
1072,gameofthrones,"She wasn't given loyal followers by her husband. 90% of them abandoned her the second Drogo died and left her to starve in the Red Waste. ""Loyalty"" isn't the word that comes to mind here. "
1073,gameofthrones,"It gets updated from time to time, if we find something is producing too many false positives, if something in the latest episode happens that requires it (example: 'Hold the door' had to be temporarily added after that episode until people had calmed down)

It's more like pruning than building."
1074,gameofthrones,Would you rather a knight of the seven kingdoms or Books 6 and 7? Personally would prefer 6 and 7 but Knight of the Seven Kingdoms provided interesting backstory 
1075,gameofthrones,What confirmed it?
1076,gameofthrones,He was born to play that part . 
1077,gameofthrones,"Spoiler alert! There is a character in Game of Thrones that looks like this painting! 

""Welp, series is ruined for me now. Thanks""."
1078,gameofthrones,Wow you're something else
1079,gameofthrones,"That makes it even worse, you sick bastard!"
1080,gameofthrones,Is it really necessary to put NO SPOILERS on everything in here? Mods must be super insecure 
1081,gameofthrones,Remind me how long the break was?
1082,gameofthrones,Wow..thats some funny shit
1083,gameofthrones,"Still though, Daya saw the kid as her own child and nothing hinted at her not seeing him as hers"
1084,gameofthrones,Given how she dealt with Jorah I don't think having been with her a long time really gives you any sort of special treatment. 
1085,gameofthrones,"See, everyone blamed Tommen for banning trial by combat. I blame Cersei. Zombie Mountain is large and intimidating but, prior to this episode, untested. No one truly knew what he was capable of. Then, she pulled her ""I choose violence"" moment to feel like a bad ass and showed the Sparrow her hand. Then he outplayed her. If she had kept her head, the Soaps would probably have believed that Robert Strong could be killed and relied on a champion instead of rigging the game."
1086,gameofthrones,"I'm glad you said this because Final Fantasy 7 is immediately what I thought of too, to the point where I googled it out of confusion. I probably would have gone on forever thinking that Paul Walker had something to do with Advent Children or something."
1087,gameofthrones,"Nice dude, it makes me almost wish my commute was slightly longer."
1088,gameofthrones,Does that mean The Mountain is really small in this universe?
1089,gameofthrones,"Thanks so much for making these, ChrysK! I've looked forward to these all season and they really make me enjoy the eps even more. :D Looking forward to more of your work!"
1090,gameofthrones,You look a lot like that youtube girl translating song in Google translate. Kathleen something. 
1091,gameofthrones,"Nope, just his taller brother.  Ned didn't need to be Bobby to beat a few squires but it is probably out of the abilities of an untrained lass."

I don't understand either of these comparisons at all"
1096,gameofthrones,Who do most people think he is?
1097,gameofthrones,"I saw Hobbit 2 and 3 at 48 fps and Though the beginning was distracting, I quickly got used to the unusual smoothness. It's just that the actions rendered with CGI quickly shatter your suspension of disbelief and your brain quickly becomes aware of the fact that it's in fact CGI and not real.

Similarly, people admired the CG Paul Walker in FF7 for being so realistic and well made that they didn't even notice it's actually CGI. Meanwhile in Tron and Rogue One people bitched about Bridges, Fischer and Cushing looking fake as shit and being right in the Uncanny Valley."
1098,gameofthrones,Shame. 
1099,gameofthrones,"You're right but people don't buy this stuff because they just want a blanket, this is a splurge when they want a conversation piece and something to keep and display. I know a guy who sells $100 rattles made out of leather and bone in a fancy niche store downtown and people buy it.. I think they are ugly as sin but people are in the market for unique handmade goods and want to support small businesses and local economy and also show off a little. So they buy this stuff as gifts and such or to treat themselves."
1100,gameofthrones,[deleted]
1101,gameofthrones,You may have missed the /s 
1102,gameofthrones,"You're wrong on all counts, but especially the one about shelters and rescuers [not buying from breeders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/dog-auction-rescue-groups-donations/?utm_term=.299587fc7225&noredirect=on).  It happens frequently under the guise of ""rescuing"" the pups, when in reality it just drives up demand for the breeders.  That article states that 25-40% of commercial breeder's revenue comes directly from rescue organizations.

Only unethical breeders don't care about their dogs.  Good breeders agree to take a dog back if the owner cannot appropriately rehome an animal.  Sometimes they'll even [put an ad out](https://i.imgur.com/gFOTYQx.png) for the owner in order to help on the first round of searching.  Most breeders make you sign a contract that says the dog will be returned to them instead of taken to a shelter, even."
1103,gameofthrones,He's going to die this season lol
1104,gameofthrones,"It doesnt really matter what direction the dragon hits from.

She cant come from the sides because she would have to go around the line and delay her attack meaning her dohtraki would be fighting inside the line as she fire breaths through it. 

She could go at it alone but the dragon would burn maybe 10% of the line before it has to reload, thats more than enough time to change formation and bring out the ballista. She would never get another chance to line burn afterwards as its not exactly hard to keep track of a huge dragon in the sky. 

The only real chance she has is to fly through the line but tell the dragon to use its fire breath horizontally which still wouldnt be an easy win because they can just spread randomly to reduce the fire breath effectiveness. 

However if they choose to spread randomly then thats a guaranteed win for the dohtraki if they show up afterwards which is why having a dragon is a huge advantage due to what you're forcing your opponent to do. "
1105,gameofthrones,"It was absolute not the norm to be married at 12-13. It is known to have happened but it wasn't happening all the time. Henry VII Tudor was born when his mother Margaret Beaufort was about 13 and it was noted as not being a good thing or standard procedure.

You might be betrothed at that age but normally the wedding would wait. GRRM has even said in Westeros brides that young were rare, most would wait until they were 16, hence why Sansa and Joff are betrothed with no real plans made for the wedding compared to Margeary who is married only a few months after the betrothed is made. "
1106,gameofthrones,Hot take: The ending will piss everyone off 
1107,gameofthrones,"does look like him!

  Maybe next week we can read rumors that Lady Mormont has secret parentage and a legitmate claim to the throne because foreshadowing."
1108,gameofthrones,Or Night King conquers them all :P we shall see. 
1109,gameofthrones,"I'd rather see Dunk and Egg come to life or the Blackfyre Rebellion. 

With the right actor Bloodraven could be one of the greatest characters in TV history. His shadow hangs over all the stories and his one appearance at the end of the last short story is pure awesome."
1110,gameofthrones,"So, Jon=Luke, Dany=Leia, Bronn=Han Solo and Night's King=Vader. 

So who's who for TFA characters then?"
1111,gameofthrones,"Little finger: Hi, Bran. Arya wants to be the queen in the north, and she's planning on killing Sansa. You are the only one who can stop her.

Bran: Yeah, they are playing you. Get out while you still can.

: later that day :

Sansa: Wtf, Bran, why did you tell him that?

Bran: I've seen so many things, Sansa. I don't have time for silly games. I'm the three eyed raven now, I've got bigger things to worry about."
1112,gameofthrones,"But the magic did work. Watch the scene again, they make a point to show snow melting away the next morning when shireen was found. "
1113,gameofthrones,I thought for sure I was on r/trees
1114,gameofthrones,Yeah! She is a big fan. 
1115,gameofthrones,"Jon Snow, Gendry, Sandor Clegane, Jorah Mormont, Davos Seaworth, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myrr, and Tormund Giantsbane all together. What a wild fucking ride this show has turned out to be."
1116,gameofthrones,Holy shit that actually makes sense to me now. Or am I just stupid?
1117,gameofthrones,probably hiding for a heroic last moment wild card where he saves jon and then dies
1118,gameofthrones,"Let's be real for a second, has GRRM directly said the faceless men *can't* turn into dolphins?"
1119,gameofthrones,Op can’t you see you just aren’t the one for me
1120,gameofthrones,"Regardless, I think there's something to this: http://imgur.com/a/XTiTm"
1121,gameofthrones,And you didn't even need the breastplate stretcher. 
1122,gameofthrones,"Might want to give it a month or so before the premiere. speaking from MY own personal experience, it takes you a while to learn how to walk, talk, and coordinate correctly after a coma."
1123,gameofthrones,Compared to the American piss beer that was listed? It's fantastic.
1124,gameofthrones,"His plots rely on people following their own interests, or being driven by emotion.  Lysa loved him and was more than happy to get rid of Jon. Cat was more than ready to get millions of smallfolk killed just because she assumed the Lannisters were targeting her family. The Tyrells would benefit none from letting Joff live, and Tywin wouldn't look to closely because Tommen was the better option.  Ned got himself killed when he chose to not throw in with Renly and expected Littlefinger to go against his own interests. Since Ned couldn't be easily manipulated through emotion and neither would he follow his own interests, he had to go."
1125,gameofthrones,Yeah it was so sad. It seemed the Bloodraven planned it the entire time which is why they were in that vision when the WW came knocking. He knew it would happen and that he would have to have Bran sacrifice Hodor and turn Wylis into Hodor that moment. He even tells Bran to listen to his friend in the vision :(
1126,gameofthrones,"""Buncha cunts in this bag."""
1127,gameofthrones,OMFG the music and the transitions!!!!! you Sr. deserve the most viewed video in Youtube. My respect to you and congrats!
1128,gameofthrones,"""yeah Emilia, we're going to have to shoot just _one_ _more_ ending here. Okay, in this one you're naked (again) just kinda walking around. Then lay on that bed."""
1129,gameofthrones,"Dude that line.

I wonder how many dudes sporting man buns at GoT season premiere parties go a look"
1130,gameofthrones,"Well I think that Jon Snow being named Jon Arryn is in the books, but the connection between the two relationships couldn't be in the books because the books haven't revealed Jon's parentage. "
1131,gameofthrones,"I may be wrong, but to my knowledge that was the first time Djwadi incorporated the piano into the score. The choice to do so added so much more dynamic to the scene, it was truly devastating to watch. "
1132,gameofthrones,"May we have the story, my Lord??"
1133,gameofthrones,"At this point Arya could defeat the Whitewalkers on her own and I'd buy it. 

She's like the most competent character in this entire show."
1134,gameofthrones,"This was amazing, I snorted air out my nose rather hard this time."
1135,gameofthrones,...wizard Harry!
1136,gameofthrones,Please post an updated photo of him after the Red Wedding...
1137,gameofthrones,"Reminds me of my favorite show back home, six white complainers!"
1138,gameofthrones,Each brick is the size of the White House 
1139,gameofthrones,I stand corrected.  Think it would be a pretty controversial call if King Jon decreed himself a trueborn Targaryen though.
1140,gameofthrones,I heard that as the start of the office theme in my head
1141,gameofthrones,"I guess that's a polite way to say ""uhhhh... Your body is fucked up"" "
1142,gameofthrones,Maybe you can do Old Dany when GRRM releases winds of winter in 2044
1143,gameofthrones,Mayhaps Lord Frey isn't wise enough to notice such details
1144,gameofthrones,"She is the descendent of a king and is supposed to be a queen, I'd assume looks kinda matter if all those stories about good-looking royals that've been written throughout human history are something to base that off of."
1145,gameofthrones,too much of a good thing is also a bad thing
1146,gameofthrones,I swear to god I was thinking he was gonna pop him open and it would reveal he was a beer the entire time
1147,gameofthrones,"Hell, ride ‘em both!"

1149,gameofthrones,"""World needs bad men. We keep the other bad men from the door."" - Rustin Cohle"
1150,gameofthrones,WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE!!!!
1151,gameofthrones,"Really well made. They should of let Arya, complete that smile. It was just building up."
1152,gameofthrones,His hair always looks wet for some reason.
1153,gameofthrones,"That kinda already happened at the end of last season but everybody just sort of forgot about it. A real ""live and let learn"" moment, apparently."
1154,gameofthrones,Imagine if that was how he actually died? After being revived so many times 
1155,gameofthrones,tyrion is marvellous
1156,gameofthrones,"If I remember correctly, they are a house living on the westernmost Iron Island. I think it's so far west it's not visible on this map."
1157,gameofthrones,Are there more books similar to the storm light archive out there? I'm in love with sandersons work already finished all mistborn out there. The king killer chronicles is also amazing. Wanna read more books like that any recommendations besides wheel of time? 
1158,gameofthrones,[removed]
1159,gameofthrones,What does one call this weapon? 
1160,gameofthrones,"I was watching one of the post episode shows, and they were basically saying something like how there less need for the nuanced plot storylines and politics, because everything's coming to an end now. Still though, if I could subtract a couple dragon fight scenes for an extra episode of character moments I totally would. Last season missed the little things. Like we could've use some update s on cercei' torture victims for instance, or a better thought out demise for little finger. "
1161,gameofthrones,Great. I was pretty slow with agot different from the show as it was and Ive yet to rent COK although I read the 200 page sample pretty quick. I thought fire and blood was awesome tho I coudnt put down agot quick enough and I really couldnt put down fire and blood read like 200 pages a day.
1162,gameofthrones,[deleted]
1163,gameofthrones,Well that was before he completed his Jedi training apparently.
1164,gameofthrones,Link to stark one?
1165,gameofthrones,"Coolest thing about the knife toss is that it's done in a close up in the episode, so it's not like she *needed* to be able to pull it off like that. Good on the choreographer and good on Maisie Williams for going for it."
1166,gameofthrones,"Thought you were joking, I've only ever known Ajax as a cleaning product.

1167,gameofthrones,"Some of them are better artists than writers.  A great comic requires both good art and witty writing, and it's rare for a single person to excel at both.  A lot of great writers are poor artists (xkcd) and a lot of great artists are middling writers. "
1168,gameofthrones,Why would Spider-Man go up Thanos' butt?
1169,gameofthrones,Excited for TI7 Main Stage? :D
1170,gameofthrones,I'm pretty sure the artist snuck a sperm into the big dragon.
1171,gameofthrones,ON the map.
1172,gameofthrones,"No one in that scene is wearing a helmet,  tbf."
1173,gameofthrones,"that's not a fair comparison. Jamie has had *8 seasons of character development*, with one of the defining moments of his backstory being that he saved the entirety of King's Landing from the mad king by making a selfless decision, to forever besmirch his reputation by killing a king he was sworn to protect for the the greater good.

That is NOT a fair comparison to rapist pillager khal drogo, who i'm pretty sure is jokingly referenced to have killed a woman by fucking her to death. I mean, jesus christ.

Hitler had dogs and apparently loved a woman, Eva Braun. He probably had tender moments with her and the dog. Does this mean he wasn't pure evil? I mean, what argument are you trying to make

Like whatever characters you want to like, but that doesn't mean it's weird and off-putting. damn"
1174,gameofthrones,"Only direct connection is between Warbreaker and Oathbringer, and even then it's a very small connection."

1188,gameofthrones,Sad there wasn't more Tyene Sand!
1189,gameofthrones,Wasn’t he poisoned?
1190,gameofthrones,Looks wonderful.
1191,gameofthrones,"True Blood was never a great show, point is, HBO is very guilty of ending shows worse than what they started after multiple first seasons.

The pacing in GoT has become exceedingly fast with multiple omissions and added unnecessary garbage.

I also do not understand why they don't film a few seasons at once, by season 10 its going to be hard for a 24 year old to pull of a 13 year old.
"
1192,gameofthrones,"Raise them in a sterilized environment so the shell doesn’t get infected, give them with anabolic steroids to make them stronger enough to move after they moult."
1193,gameofthrones,"Anyone know if OP has made the printing instructions / cad file available? 

I bought a few of these for friends this year since they were on sale at costco; this would put them all......over the top."
1194,gameofthrones,Or the final season of Dexter!
1195,gameofthrones,appare tly the direwolves use more CGI than the dragons so ghost's scene got cut from se 7 and they only used it for nymeria 
1196,gameofthrones,Yeah I did that once but I'm not quite sure how to frame the thing. Would probably be expensive
1197,gameofthrones,"Don't know if they'd be sent, but they'd get the same choice that anyone serving under Dany gets.

""So, thanks guys. I'm gonna stay here on this throne now. You can go home if you want, I'll provide ships. Or you can stay here, but you gotta chill out and behave.""

99% would be gone within a fortnight. Those guys want to conquer Westeros, not live in it. "
1198,gameofthrones,Sanaa is one of the most realistic characters in the show and to a lesser extent the books. She actually acts like a young girl would in her situation. Most of the other youth act much older than they are. 
1199,gameofthrones,and she's got a bit of the beard going.

1213,gameofthrones,"Oh, I think she would. I just think she'd be a bit sad over losing what she is now. Being a faceless man is a whole different level than being competent with a sword. I think she'd sigh, think being an elite assassin was fun while it lasted and then do the right thing. But she'd be a bit sad over losing her current self"

1225,gameofthrones,"I agree with most of this, but wasn't Renly gay in the books? My memory is fuzzy, but I thought book Brienne had a thing for feminine boys (Renly and Loras) until she met Jaime. Maybe it was just that the gay men didn't care about her womanhood at all and so were decent to her.

1262,gameofthrones,"Actually between the first 3 books, there's only 2-3 years in between them all. That's when GRRM didn't have to go to so

1265,gameofthrones,"I don't think so because GRRM said in an interview that his wife had the book rights, never said anything about anyone else. Show might be different, but even so, GRRM told the directors how the story would end. So the show can still finish for sure the way GRRM has it, even with the books unfinished."
1266,gameofthrones,"As someone who does a lot of cross stitching, you really can't make a go of most of it. Stuff like the picture can be done decently fast, maybe a handful of hours, but anything more significant (basically anything where you fill in everything instead of leaving gaps) is impossible to make your time back in profit. You can check my post history for some examples, both of those, while being smaller than a piece of paper, took me over 400 hours. Doubt anyone will be willing to pay $4000 for them :P

I listened to the final track before the episode aired, but seeing/listening to that scene gave me goosebumps. That final shot where you see her hundreds upon hundreds of boats spanning the horizon while that music crescendos just made the episode for me."

Don't they say in the books that he studied under Archmaester Marwyn, the one responsible for the studies of magic and it was his fusion of science and dark magic that caused the maesters to ban Qyburn?"

1280,gameofthrones,"What do they know of waiting? Waiting is for the long night, when children are born and live and die, all before the next book comes out."
1281,gameofthrones,"Exactly my point. 

Previously, he was appointed Hand of the King because... he was a Lannister. Despite not getting the title on his own merits, he went above and beyond to  prove he deserved it. Then Tywin comes in and take the title himself, being head of the Lannisters.

Now, he gets the title again, but *strictly* because he deserves it. Dany let him live because he didn't deserve to die. She didn't banish him, but took him on as an adviser because he was valuable. Finally, he becomes Hand of the Queen because he earned it *and* was recognized as the best candidate.

That's why it's so emotional. He's always deserved recognition, but it's honestly the first time he achieved something, good or bad, on his own merits."

1331,gameofthrones,"Yep, they only did the introductions during early season 1. Quarth and Dragonstone didn't come in until season 2."
1332,gameofthrones,It's easier to read about this happening to a child in a book than seeing it on screen. On screen it seems more real. I imagine early test screenings had people be really uncomfortable with the situations so making everyone ~16+ keeps them quite young but makes it easier for people to swallow. 
1333,gameofthrones,"> I'd give last episode something between a 7-8 but almost a perfect score? That just seems insane to me, for my tastes at least.

I'd say it's a solid 9, but I'd accept someone saying it's an 8.  Something to remember though, all the other big episodes in the past have gotten similar scores when they first aired but they go down over time.  I blame hype really.  This show has been hyping up dragons for so long and we finally got a good look at one in battle."
1334,gameofthrones,As is tradition. 
1335,gameofthrones,"If you press against the encirclement, you're offering your flank and you get pincered. There was no way to fight their way out of that without a second unit to hit the flank, which they didn't have until the Vale arrived.

Yes, Jon's plot arrow deflection was annoying, but the Boltons encircling wasn't unrealistic in the least.

Ramsey killing WunWun was completely consistent with his character. If he was going to die, he was going to cause Jon as much pain as possible on the way out."

1352,gameofthrones,"Aye but they're right at the beginning, and attached to the basic title of the monarch of the Iron Throne; Ruler of the seven kingdoms, or the Andals and the first men yadda yadda.

In my view that whole thing is essentially like giving Elizabeth II her full title; Queen Elizabeth II. There's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to that goddamned quagmire;

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_titles_and_honours_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II"
1353,gameofthrones,"Well he went from a behind-the-scenes type schemer to a frontline powerhouse. He might not have the power of the crown's wallet anymore, but he does effectively own an entire kingdom now, if not only temporarily. But keep in mind that his legitimacy as Lord Regent or whatever of the Vale is constantly questioned, since the means by which he obtained that title were under such scrutiny at the time. To maintain that power, he'd have to keep using the same kind of deception and underhandedness that he honed in KL."

1384,gameofthrones,"Now, this would really be impressive if you had to make a drink for each cocktail sword."
1385,gameofthrones,"I'm just curious what would you call a hidden group of knight's in this world? If not a hidden army?

Jon's knowing of the Knight's Of Vale isn't relative to this conversation because we're talking about Ramsay's strategy. It doesn't matter what Jon knew, it matters what Ramsay's thought process was when he decided to attack Jon in open battle vs. a siege behind Winterfell's walls. Yes, he likely heard from loyal Houses that Jon was having trouble recruiting, but there's more to Westeros than just the North. So that's limited thinking on Ramsay's part, he could have foresaw outsiders coming to aid Jon. Mercenaries, how does Ramsay know how many forces beyond the wall are helping him, etc? I understand they have scouts, but kinda like what Robb stark did in Season 2 / book 2. He attacked X with 1/5th of his men then attacked elsewhere with the rest, and captured Jamie. (correct me if I'm remembering this wrong) We also know the North remembers conspiracy within the books, what's stopping Houses who were loyal to House Stark for thousands of years to betray Ramsay at the last moment? (something I thought was going to happen on the show, as many others thought, Karstarks/Umbers)

1406,gameofthrones,You're on the wrong thread then. There were so many stand out moments in this episode but this one was the only one that made me all warm and fuzzy. T+B would be awesome but GOT rarely makes you that happy without soul raping you soon after so I fear the Magnificent Seven will be a man or two short on their return trip 😭 
1407,gameofthrones,"The difference is in LOTR the main plot is already concluded at that point, so it's more like an epilogue. In GOT, we're still far away from plot climax/resolution."

1416,gameofthrones,"Man, I just love the way Charlie walks on LOST, the way it just complements his clumsy but lovable nature, amazing."
1417,gameofthrones,Wait what?   Where is it mentioned a krakken has been seen?  BOoks or movies?  I always thought that when the iron king or whatever fell from the bridge that a sea death/sacrifice would call the Krakken into play.  Sort of like the other sacrifices that were needed for the other dragons.

1421,gameofthrones,"The red wedding in the book was so well done too. The whole chapter there’s a sense of dread building, but it’s so subtle you don’t even consciously acknowledge it. The music, and Cat’s insistence of eating the food and earning guests’ rights... I didn’t think it was real when I read it. I thought there was nowhere to progress the story after that point"
1422,gameofthrones,"He didn't 'get' what he was supposed to be doing with Stannis, which isn't a surprise because neither did the show's writers."

They’re on record multiple times saying their goal is to mirror the books (and intended events yet unwritten) as much as they can. They’ve also explicitly stated that GRRM has told them how the books will end and the show will reflect that.

There’s no reason for them to suddenly shift and give an unnecessarily ‘fairy tale’ ending when they’ve done their best to preserve GRRM’s core story as much as possible. "

While every other pretender to the throne has been power hungry, they've had a devoted following beforehand. Sure, she's amassed one with the Dothraki and the Unsullied, but it always felt like they were obtained to further her goal, rather than her furthering her goal because they willed it.

She does seem to be set up to take the throne back and defeat the White Walkers as well which, this being Game of Thrones, means it simply can't happen. Or at least, it can't happen simply."

Split is awesome but not much happens outside the old town. Best beach is probably round the back at Uvala Zvoncac? I think. You can also climb the headland at Park Marjan which is awesome. City centre one shopping mall is a 20 minute bus ride (number 16? I think) and is full of retail stores if you need anything specific.

That's one of the most compelling stories next season for me, how she copes with the fact that she still actually has family. She has become such a dark character now. I mean, she was dark in the first place, killing people and promising to kill people and such, but most of those were for survival. This time around, though, she baked 2 people into a pie and fed it to another person, before killing said person. That is bat shit dark now and I wonder how the rest of the family will react when they see what she's become."

Arya has dreams as Nymeria leading a pack of wolves around the forest, Jon has some dreams as Ghost, and Bran of course is the best at controlling it.

And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit! Indeed, the very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth! Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?

And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people! So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!

For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both the heavens and the earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever! Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment! Aye, and deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man! 

Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!"
1623,gameofthrones,She really resembles Sansa in this shot. Really cool how they got the genealogy pretty on point looks-wise.
1624,gameofthrones,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BlEzu-O_ZkU/hqdefault.jpg not very big but oh well

1626,gameofthrones,"Someone fully sampled everything they could smoke, snort or shoot up from a police evidence locker."
1627,gameofthrones,"But towards the end he started using other arrows, so there is still a sliver of a chance it was him.  Just enough to have that pinprick of doubt."
1628,gameofthrones,"I know this guy and done a few scenes with him. He wasn't Liam Cunningham's stand in at all, he tells that lie to everyone because he looks slightly like him.  He was a minor extra in the background like the rest of us. Only difference is that he got a real sense of self entitlement and grandeur along with it."
1629,gameofthrones,"I was gone ask, what about ATLA? Zuko's ark is so good."
1630,gameofthrones,"Yes, it was so clever! As disgusting as it was. My SO has had the image stuck in his head all week. He keeps saying ""I really didn't need that in my life."" Lol "
1631,gameofthrones,"> Arya and Sansa's reunion fell flat to me.

To me it looked like 2 actors without chemistry pretending to be close, though tbh that could be an accurate portrayal of sisters haha.

>The spar between Arya and Brienne annoyed me too because it got kinda ridiculous. 

Same I was actaully scared to mention it here becuase people were going crazy over it. Arya to me was always an assassin first and a sword fighter second (if at all). Brienne is a sword fighter without equal, and they are having a sword fight battleground style spar. +100 Brienne shouldve destroyed her. Aryas only training with traditional sword fighting was the orignal guy in series/book 1.

1632,gameofthrones,"It’s majority is filmed here. Titanic studios in belfast, there’s currently green screens up around a lot of the area near the studio along with the sets. Quite a few locations up the north coast are used as-well. It’s a

1645,gameofthrones,Looks cool though
1646,gameofthrones,Love that Lady Mormont was so unimpressed with Ramsey! I hope we get to see more from her in the Winterfell story.
1647,gameofthrones,"Ramsay: yes harder daddy

Jon: What

Ramsay: What"
1648,gameofthrones,"Correct.  It was further popularized by heavy use in the military, especially by soldiers who were actually homosexual, which I always found strange but whatever.   Memes gonna meme.   "
1649,gameofthrones,[deleted]
1650,gameofthrones,"It is ridiculous. They are both very pretty and young, they both have nice skin in candid photos....how much additional editing does a beautiful 23 year old need?  What is even being touched up at that point?  "
1651,gameofthrones,"People will generally accept things if that’s is how the universe is supposed to work. In 40k people accept psykers, because they follow the universes rules, but people don’t accept backflipping terminators because they don’t follow the universes rules, even though both are fundamentally fantastical. The same applies here, human biology still applies in game of thrones as well as magic, so both should be shown in the show."

1653,gameofthrones,I didn't understand a word of that. Google in progress
1654,gameofthrones,Plus waaay too much time has past. She’s a skeleton by now

1662,gameofthrones,"She comes across as a very genuine person in interviews, and seems like you could have the craic with her. But she has some very obnoxious moments in the show, which I think is more due to the direction of everything centred around her while more interesting characters like Tyrion and Varys are completely sidelined."

1672,gameofthrones,"This is seriously well done. The silhouettes are so clear and the moments or times they depict very recognizable, but the backgrounds are just gorgeous. I love the observers in each panel as well (though I missed the middle one at first!) and I suppose there are multiple meanings that can be given to them, but I like to think they mean Arya was never really alone, even though she did it by herself."

1674,gameofthrones,"There's actually some other stuff that goes on with him, if you've ever seen [this image](http://i.imgur.com/1rcmc4F.jpg) I think it's related to his suicide in the world of Dr. Who, especially since he's shown to be a bit out of his mind in the background when you see it."
1675,gameofthrones,"My original idea may have backfired. I first put the filter because it was hard to read the quotes with a regular photo, then I just had fun adding the sigils in the filtered photos. Some do look bad, sorry about that."
1676,gameofthrones,"I would love for Arya to have an ambiguous ending. Like she goes into some kind of conflict, *someone* emerges victorious. Maybe she's wearing a face, or maybe she's dead."

1680,gameofthrones,Tbh he's already undead... It's just that the lord of light undead is a bit different as with each resurrection you lose a bit of your mind. 
1681,gameofthrones,"Serious question though, why did he need to be killed separately from the others? He was on his way to the sept anyway. Maybe that's the way Qyburn pays his little birds? A lil stabby time once a month or so? "
1682,gameofthrones,"He trusts him about as far as he can throw him, which is a little more than every one else."
1683,gameofthrones,"No, no, Benjen is Euron."

1691,gameofthrones,"I don't doubt Euron sailed the world, I'm just pointing out that he was lying about being scared. I don't like the line because Euron has such a reputation that no one should believe he would run away scared.

1701,gameofthrones,I heard they were spotted in Belfast close to where GOT was filming at the time last year. Is the stuff for the Twins filmed in Belfast? If not I dunno when they would appear.
1702,gameofthrones,I've been really tempted to read those books but it's just such a commitment. I haven't read any Robert Jordan but Brandon Sanderson is probably my favorite author right now and I know he helped finish it when RJ died. 
1703,gameofthrones,What about bran is he eligible too? Being a greenseer and fuck knows his age and if hes lived mamy lives before
1704,gameofthrones,"Haha, you're welcome.  Sophie does an excellent portrayal, but her facial features just seem far too southern and not what I pictured from GRRM.  Sure there's the Tully side to take into account, but there needs to be some Northern, Stark-ish structure to make it authentic.  IMO, you nailed it, whether you meant to or not."

1712,gameofthrones,"> Coach Aeric Tyrell.

FTFW."
1713,gameofthrones,"Don’t think it’s about cost of adding a dire wolf, it’s more the practicality of it. A fight scene would be a lot harder to film if you had to shoot it with keeping Jon and his dire wolf in mind at all times. I think it’s an added problem for the production team when they have already conveyed the dire wolf message to the fans through the few shots we get of them. It’s not easy to film for CGI characters already let alone one that would be as active as a dire wolf and in chaotic scenes like fight scenes.

I think we were so spoiled in the first few seasons of the show that the fans have forgot about the reality of filming these shows. For example last season people were complaining about characters traveling so fast and story lines kind of disappearing quickly.  They could have made this show  9 seasons and have much more attention to the detail, but the reality is the show needs to end, these actors have been doing this since 2010. It gets harder and harder each year to sure up actor commitment. Plus the staff and everyone else that needs to move on from working on 1 project for 9 years. "

1721,gameofthrones,"It's not like real armor does anything. Or that the whole reason that 'prisoners of war' and 'ransom' are a significant part of our lexicon and the way we think of war because nobles were nearly impossible to kill in battle, unless you tried really hard to do exactly that, because of armor.  Or that decent plate could take bullets, arrows, crossbow bolts, most sword strikes and glancing blows of any weapon in use at the time. But no, if some screaming horse-fucker taps you with his fucking curved sword, you just die on impact, regardless of armor. 

Obviously it wouldn't do anything against dragonfire, but for fucks sake.


I get it, but for fucks sake."
1722,gameofthrones,"She's arrogant immediately after he's dead, in fact she is a while before too. At that point she's won no victories. I liked her until the first time I saw S6 but after that I can't really see her as genuine, for example at the end of S3 she seems to revel in being a liberator more than she care about the actual liberation. I might be wrong but the further I got into the more it felt as though she did it all to look moral rather than because it was right. Maybe she even became like that over time but I can't really watch the earlier seasons without wondering what her motives are anymore and whether she's genuine. She's definitely interesting and does good things no matter what her motivea for that are but it appears after she gets a taste for conquest in Astapor (which I believe was based in morality) she starts to become addicted to it and using excuses to justify it. As I say I may be wrong but that's how I've seen it since the end of S6."
1723,gameofthrones,"Ramsey was going to win the battle anyways as far as he knew, so it didn't really matter if Rickon could avoid the arrows. The contingency plan if Rickon dodged the arrow was to recapture him after the battle."
1724,gameofthrones,What?
1725,gameofthrones,"I may be wrong but I think it used to be larger than waist height still in those places, that is just the rubble of rocks that remains. It also had lots of forts and watch towers along the length of the wall. That being said there were certainly many Roman forts and the like north of the wall. "
1726,gameofthrones,This is a good thing.
1727,gameofthrones,Nowy tends.
1728,gameofthrones,"My friend is like that and I used to do exactly what you described. Then we were watching the scene where Theon returns to the iron islands, and he asked where he was. I told him if he put his phone down he might actually be able to follow along because I was sick of explaining everything to him. "
1729,gameofthrones,"Yeah, but the show doesn't really help in explaining how young Dany is. If it was Arya or Sansa we'll give her a pass."
1730,gameofthrones,"You're thinking of artists or illustration majors.

1731,gameofthrones,"I'd say varies by episode and then an average over the course of the season.

Last season he was less main character and more supporting. Over all he's totally a main character. "

1734,gameofthrones,Sansa and Arya genuinely at odds with each other. It's as simple as that.
1735,gameofthrones,Oh man this is gaining serious traction. 
1736,gameofthrones,"He probably knows details about Lyanna. 

Remember that Robert's Rebellion, which lead to the fall of the Mad King, all started because Robert thought Rhygar raped and murdered Lyanna who was Robert's wife to be. "
1737,gameofthrones,Most likely because bleaching eyebrows is a lot more permanent than wearing contacts...

1743,gameofthrones,"On top of that the original Targaryens were very culturally sensitive and even partially integrated into Westerosi society, instead of trying to force Westeros to suddenly become New Valyria. Whereas Dany has proven that she doesn't care at all about people's cultures or traditions. Her conquests and liberations must immediately integrate into her view of the world, no matter how foreign it seems to them.... and on top of that she's spent the past couple of seasons showing signs of her father and brother's madness. Why couldn't she just be an artist and a lot and taje after Raegar snd the Dornish side of the family? lmfao"

He defied Stannis' authority (which he truly respected) risking his own life just to save Gendry. When he lost everything he pledged his life to Jon and his cause, knowing he's the right person to defend the world from the long Night. Hell, he was going to die into that room at the Black Castle, side to side with a bunch of men he didn't even know just to defend Jon's body. He truly is an amazing character."

1773,gameofthrones,"Makes sense, thanks. I thought maybe Bear Island, with their First Men roots, is a bit like the Neck in the sense they still use some First Men related weapons like daggers. And being a poor island maybe it's something Bear Islanders all learn growing up. I was wondering if maybe he reverted back to his roots I guess since he's back in the North. Either way, it was a good tactical choice since he has the skills as you mention and daggers weigh you down less when fighting in bulky furs."

1836,gameofthrones,Very Melisandre
1837,gameofthrones,Hahaha I have been there
1838,gameofthrones,"In terms of the outfit, I think what we are looking at is simply noble garb. Tyrion’s attire hasn’t changed much since season 2, in reality the only thing that has really changed are the patterns and adornments. In earlier seasons he wore accessories and adornments that signifies he was a member of House Lannister, and once he started serving as hand of the king while Tywin was away he started wearing similar patterns to his father but the pieces and tunic he wore remained the same style continuously. He also wore the hand pin on his right side. In the latest seasons he’s been matching Danny’s color scheme especially since his return to Westeros. His tunic matches that of both Tywin and Ned Stark, although Ned’s was more simple, presumably crafted by northern tailors in the image of southern nobility with northern materials. So the clothing itself is to draw a common thread between hands, but the patterns and materials represent where the individual comes from.

When it comes to the hand, I think it’s on opposite sides because it’s the opposing throne and it’s silver in contrast to the gold of Lannisters / kings landing. I think it represents a devotion to the realm rather than the house in power, as Ned Stark also wears his hand pin on the left side. Digging a little deeper I noticed that the hand being on the right side is essentially where one would put the badge had they placed it on themselves assuming while looking in a mirror, but if it’s on the left it is to the viewer’s right, perhaps symbolizing that someone else bestowed the title of hand upon them. It could also be since Tyrion served as hand to two different thrones, the opposite side means he is literally a different hand. At the battle of Blackwater, Tyrion’s hand emblem depicts a hand with chains, foreshadowing his upcoming encounter with Shae."

1857,gameofthrones,"> There's the ""blaze of glory"" approach, but now you have someone with an army but nothing else that has no source of supply or anything. This is clearly a terrible strategy because all the cities can just hide behind walls and deal with the starving unsullied.

I disagree. If Dany just buys some Unsullied and marches away, she's missing supply and logistics (and a dragon). Now, if she conquers Astapor, she has a supply source and a place to properly rule from. If she didn't start at Astapor, she would either have to conquer some other Free City first, or go straight for Westeros (I suppose this was the expected outcome after the transaction). Otherwise she's just a girl with 8000 soldiers doing nothing in a desert."

1865,gameofthrones,Oh Jack. 
1866,gameofthrones,"No, I think it makes sense. The problem of this tale is that a princess cannot become a queen unless she marries; which I assume is supposed to be a metaphor for the outdated idea that a woman cannot have power or authority on her own, only if she has a man at her side. And Princess Dany (being only 13 or 16) simply does not want to get married, so she finds a way of becoming queen without having to do so. 

A teenager probably shouldn't be ruling over an entire kingdom either, but hey. It's a children's book ;) "

It will be kind of like when the Dark Tower series released Keyhole almost a decade after the final book.  It took place in the middle of the saga, but it was fun to go back and revisit the characters.

In 5-10 years when the final books come out after the show is wrapped up, you'll have similar feelings of nostalgia and will want to revisit."

1951,gameofthrones,"Yeah the whole ""hard to explain"" thing didn't sit well with me."
1952,gameofthrones,"I think it was a lack of foresight when writing last season combined with the extremely negative reception their own Dorne storyline got.

Just like the brotherhood without banners (including Gendry) they thought they needed to add Doran to the story so they did.  After the season was over though they started looking ahead and realized ""wait, we don't need Doran for the streamlined version (or entirely different version) of the story we're telling, it was a mistake to include this in the first place.""  After they saw what the audience reaction to their story was the decision was pretty simple.  The writers didn't want anything to do with Dorne, and the watchers didn't want anything to do with the show's version of Dorne, so they give it a couple minutes in this season's premiere to tie it up any possible loose ends, and now there's more screen time for the older characters and we can just forget they ever included Dorne in the show in the first place."

Jon may be half Targ, and that may be how he claims the throne (assuming that happens), but he will rule and act as a Stark and a Northerner. He will utilize what connections and abilities being a Targ affords him, but he will not feel or act primarily as anything other than a Stark or even a Snow.

1996,gameofthrones,Battle of the Bastards fucks over every other “epic” fantasy fight ever filmed.

We saw them going south of the wall, did they all corroborate Jon's story? When? Who did they tell? As far as we know  they didn't tell the watch shit. Also aren't the only Night's Watch that made it back Jon & Dolorous Edd? Pretty sure the rest got killed.

> Everyone at the wall also know about the wight coming to life in S1, so they know they exist.

You mean where Jon killed a Wight with only Jeor Mormont present then they burnt the body? Presumably nobody else saw it. Once again, seeing white walkers and an army of the dead is much different than hearing about it, especially when you've been raised to believe they don't exist. 

> but 13 year olds aren't ""emotionally underdeveloped children""

Yes they are. It's a scientific fact your brain is underdeveloped at that point, kids that age generally don't make emotionally mature decisions.

> It's not that olly's an emotionally undeveloped child, it's that he's retarded.

Well shit, you got me there. Olly killed Jon because he's retarded. That's why D&D created this character, that's the main takeaway they wanted the viewers to have, that Olly did this and hates wildlings because he's retarded. Lol. Very sophisticated analysis there. You're just too smart for those successful and intelligent writers, aren't you!

Also lmao at this:

> When I was a teenager I wasn't a bumbling idiot.

2060,gameofthrones,"I would actually say that out of the three, marrying Myrcella to Theon was the least smart given the Ironborn desire from independence of the Iron Throne/hatred for greenlanders/mainlanders, and given that the Vale and Dorne both had reasons not to like the Lannisters but could very easily be subdued into *not contributing to the Lannister downfall* when actively pushing for them to join into the war on the Lannister side was harder "

2100,gameofthrones,">I don't now if pig's blood for example is good enough for you, nor if it is legal

Why would it be illegal?"
2101,gameofthrones,"What I love about this season is how much Ned Stark is still contributing to the story. His honesty and integrity to keep his word led to Jon Snow to being honest at the pit, Arya and Sansa to remember his famous saying about their family, Theon's bravery to confront his men, and even Jon's secret that has kept him safe all these years at great cost. 

Ned is such an important character and this episode really drove that home 

EDIT: Not only affecting Theon's choices, he's the one that practically took him on as a son to begin with. He also advised against murdering the Targaryen children, which leads us to where we are now with Dany. And he recognized and encouraged Arya's interest in fighting, which led to her choices to become a great weapon in the fight (and also her knowledge to recognize Little finger's shit). Ned is definitely a story catalyst in many ways "
2102,gameofthrones,"""So much room for activities"""
2103,gameofthrones,"Both the Hound and Arya know that Littlefinger betrayed Ned, so one of them will probably relay that information to Winterfell in one way or another."
2104,gameofthrones,I wish people would stop taking Tywin's quote out of context. 
2105,gameofthrones,"I think modern fantasy has skewed what we think of as well defined. I know a hell of a lot more about Middle Earth, how it was made, their gods, and their magic than I do about anything in ASOIF. Everything in Middle Earth is about good vs. evil and light vs. darkness, and while ASOIF has somewhat polarized themes and mentions light vs. dark (lord of light and the long dark) the world itself is actually so very much more grey and vague. We don't really know these gods, their motivations, or the extent of their powers or plans."
2106,gameofthrones,And to think it probably just started off as a peaceful alt-wight march...

It's really damaging to my nerd cred. I'm glad the movies exist, too."
2109,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I can only imagine. I cosplay quite frequently and use colored contacts most of the time. After a full day my eyes start to burn so bad. I can only imagine wearing those nearly everyday for months and months. It would have been cool if they had violet eyes, but I can understand why they couldn't handle it. "
2110,gameofthrones,It is known. 
2111,gameofthrones,This artist got some serious Lunar Baboon vibes
2112,gameofthrones,"Health problems AND temperament problems. Blue pitbulls have this problem. Breeders put so much emphasis into breeding them into the right color that temperament takes a back seat. LOTS of blue pitties have serious temperament issues.

(And no. Its NOT just bc its a pit.)"
2113,gameofthrones,"I think the problem is less that the GC themselves have done it and more that the people of the free cities didn't adopt their tactics. Another example would be the fact that the cities apparently chose to pay the horse folks off.  Realistically, waiting for their horses to starve would not have taken long.  "
2114,gameofthrones,"I really hope the showrunners will elaborate that part more. I doubt it has anything to do with jealousy, although in a way it could also be Tyrion realizing his true feelings. But I have to think that it has a lot to do where he's worried their love might be a bad influence on their judgment. I would've imagined that Tyrion would be happy for them but he could also be worried that their affections might get them killed. It definitely seems like something that will be explored more when Season 8 arrives, and on top of Bran revealing to Jon his true parentage is only going to make things more interesting."

2153,gameofthrones,"See, but your argument is around an object, not the actual substance of rule and being King. The Iron Throne means nothing, what it symbolizes means everything. Aegon didn't make Westeros or any of its Kingdoms, but he claimed them. Robert did the same. He conquered the greatest House in the history of the Seven Kingdoms, meaning he has right to the Throne.

And again, my point is that Targs' claim is very small. They've only been in Westeros for a few hundred years. There's been a King in the North for MUCH longer Targs have even been in Westeros, ie technically the North has more to claim itself as an independent Kingdom than Dany does her right to rule the Seven Kingdoms.


Dany has no right to anything. She hasn't even lived in Westeros for nearly all her life."
2154,gameofthrones,Not cool man!
2155,gameofthrones,"If he doesn't want to finish them anymore that is alright too.  I would be kind of upset if he intentionally didn't provide the ending to a story I was emotionally invested in,  but since he has let the show provide an ending to the story,  I don't mind at all if he doesn't finish the books.   "
2156,gameofthrones,"It feels too designed.  I want her to reconnect with Jaime, personally.  In the end.  When the war is done.

2171,gameofthrones,I think it'll be the last thing that happens this season. 
2172,gameofthrones,I'll never understand people who have their phone in front of them when they are watching something
2173,gameofthrones,Nice!! You’ll tell him he’s the best guide
2174,gameofthrones,"I really, really appreciate the feedback. Thank you.

And yeah, this was my first foray into making a video and learning how to use editors and whatnot, so I'm a complete, total, 100% amateur. Similar to Jon Snow, I know nothing.

I was only concerned with having the music sync up with certain parts of the battle, having the overall escalation in ""No Time For Caution"" match with the increasing intensity and depravity of the battle itself, along with Jon's seemingly diminishing chances of survival. And as Jon chases Ramsay, I wanted the alternating notes of ""S.T.A.Y."" to mirror the exchanged glances between Jon and Ramsay, which culminates with the last two verses of the poem and the final shot of the light behind Jon as he walks away. :)

Thanks again for the feedback, I'm glad you enjoyed it."
2175,gameofthrones,You are a mix of Littlefinger and Joe Jonas 
2176,gameofthrones,[deleted]
2177,gameofthrones,It was a hell of a way to tell the story of that battle and completely different from any other scene they've done.
2178,gameofthrones,The king landed where?  
2179,gameofthrones,About
2180,gameofthrones,Yet Jon’s beard grew right back in a matter of hours.  The Jon/Benjen/Tyrion scene mustn’t have been from the unaired pilot.
2181,gameofthrones,"Ah right okay, thank you! I'm from the UK, and typically I've left it til last minute to sort everything out. Thanks for your replies though! "
2182,gameofthrones,So Ghost is our only hope. I bet you they kill him this season. God I hope I'm wrong though. 
2183,gameofthrones,"Jorah was kicking some ass. Held his own the whole time, saved Jon, saved Thoros. Was the first one smart enough to go all dragon glass."
2184,gameofthrones,"Malamute dogs can get really big. There's an Alaskan Malamute at the dog park that weighing in at 210lbs at 2 years old. Size comparison doesn't help when the owner is a 5'1"" Asian girl. "
2185,gameofthrones,That's fucking amazing 😂😂
2186,gameofthrones,Phrasing...
2187,gameofthrones,Well the deep South is no longer as much of an agricultural powerhouse because cotton and tobacco aren't popular anymore
2188,gameofthrones,Isn't the blue whale the largest animal to ever roam earth? 
2189,gameofthrones,Well maybe they have a strict policy about military sorties (The must always be X amounts of White Walkers back in... Ice StoneHenge or whatever that place was)
2190,gameofthrones,How many licks does it take to get to the center of an ice spear?
2191,gameofthrones,"Complexion and bone structure aside, I knew it was supposed to be Jon Snow. It’s a pretty spot on costume and the hair helps sell it. "
2192,gameofthrones,My understanding is that a greatsword is far superior for fighting multiple opponents than dual wielding.  Great big slashes in wide arcs are perfect for holding off multiple opponents because you can push right through any blocks.  With dual wielding two people just have to keep your swords busy while somebody else stabs you.
2193,gameofthrones,I want to buy that :(
2194,gameofthrones,The Wall is coming down this season. Way too many mentions of it standing and being secure for so long. The people have too much faith in it. 
2195,gameofthrones,"by who? Legitimizing a bastard is done by royal decree. IE Jon deceased father or a king. I dont see Tommen legitimizing Jon or anyone else having the ability to legitimize Jon. It would only be Sansa or LF (with his warden of the north letter from Cersei) and both have reasons not to legitmize Jon. 

Sansa might do it for what Jon has done and has been through and her respect and love for Jon. But I think she is too keen to rule Winterfell herself as Queen and marry someone matrialineally (so she stays ruler as queen and a Stark and not become a queen with a King being the real ruler and the son having the father name). If sansa legitimizes Jon it would be for another throne and purpose, like claiming the Iron throne.

What I see happening is Sansa starts to rule winterfell and LF offering/demanding a marriage with her in return for his support. (With of course a shady plot to become a ruler himself and climbing his ladder of chaos.)"
2196,gameofthrones,Nailed it!

2210,gameofthrones,"I am 100% convinced that he doesn't know how to finish the series. 

It got too big. Too many characters, and too many plots, and too many conspiracies. He doesn't know how to bring them all to together.

But he wants to milk the popularity of the series still. So he abandons the original series and writes a prequel instead. "

2226,gameofthrones,"Yes I don't doubt that the artist could draw eyes. The level of detail in this is amazing and the way the eyes show under the hair is probably harder to draw than just the eyes.

As I said I was just making a joke how for many artists eyes (and hands) are the most difficult part to draw so sometimes they might pose their characters in a way so they don't have to draw them."

2230,gameofthrones,Reference? Pretty please •_•
2231,gameofthrones,I thought it was just for aesthetics to show he's dead and decrepit. The other skeleton guys walk around with less than that and can go hundreds of miles. I think it's just for appearance sake
2232,gameofthrones,"Honestly, that's my favorite kind of spoiler. The ""No way, that has to be a joke..."" and then later ""oh SHIT it's happening!"" Adds a layer of irony to the shock."

2274,gameofthrones,"The greatest cavalry forces in the history of the world have never been able to get horses to charge into places they don't want to be with anything close to reliability. Throughout the Pike and Shot era, throughout the French Revolutionary wars, the best armies in the world, with the best trained horses maybe ever, could not get horses to charge pike or bayonet squares. The horse is not dumb, it would veer off rather than charge straight into a fire, or just stop completely. The writers had the right idea in terms of breaking open the Lannister line and then charging them (because that's essentially what they did with cannon IRL), but the horses won't do that in this situation as long as the fire is raging.

2279,gameofthrones,"Sansa doesn't make it, guaranteed. "
2280,gameofthrones,"Very likely and possible (pointing to Danny being Azor Ahai). BUT GRRMs writing is filled with a lot more irony than obviousness.

He loves leading readers on to expecting one outcome, while delivering an outcome that few(er) people could expect (until you get used to his trickery).

GRRM is a huge fan of using foreshadowing, but in the books it's almost always in a sneaky way.

So many theories are worth considering, or at least hoping for. 

That's a huge portion of why I love this storyline (both book and show) so much. 

For all I know, Dany could be 'the dragon' and 'from stone' could mean 'from cold-heartedness'. 

Imo, this is the glory of fan theories about exceptional stories."

2285,gameofthrones,"Arya has definitely a thing, for obvious reasons, for Westeros' great warrior women. She named her Direwolf after the Rhoynar princess who settled in and conquered Dorne."
2286,gameofthrones,Idk but it's boring as hell to watch.  Who knew Dany was so simple-minded?
2287,gameofthrones,"I don't think she has been abandoned, she only shows up 2 or 3 times in the books, and most of the time she is mentioned, it is just Dany thinking about her.  She'll probably show up next season."
2288,gameofthrones,"Aaand thats how you put out an eye. Kids, dont do this at home!!"
2289,gameofthrones,Nice
2290,gameofthrones,"Okay, for the final scene in the series--the white walkers are defeated and Dani and Jon Snow are in the throne room. Tyrion says ""I once brought a honeycomb and a jackass into a brothel--"" and we cut to black. Tell me with the shit they pulled with the Sopranos that they wouldn't do that?"
2291,gameofthrones,Didn't Cersei suggest that Jaime execute Bronn for arranging the meeting though? Wouldn't make a lot of sense to execute someone who you just bought.
2292,gameofthrones,"No, that would be a simpler (au naturale) costume and a much different type of Halloween party."
2293,gameofthrones,Yes. I love how each important character had their own leitmotif (the same way that different characters and houses have theirs on GoT). I can't even imagine the ending of If-Then-Else without his music and *that* character's theme playing over the visuals.

2314,gameofthrones,"Dany dreams that she fights the White Walkers at the trident, despite not even knowing what they are. If she dies it won't be until that happens. So Season 8 most likely."

2351,gameofthrones,"The fact that Davos is also standing in the light compared to Mel and Stannis is the most well lit means that he knows what he should do.  He will not do that but notice how Davos is looking at what he sees as his king and the person he means to serve well.  Mel is looking at Davos and sees him as a rival and interference.  The candelabra centered on the head of Stannis the Mannis is symbolic of the crown that he feels should be on his head but is out of his reach for now.  Notice it is unlit as it stands, for light would stand for the wisdom of the king and he is not showing that wisdom.  I am talking out of my ass but it sure sounds good to me. "

2364,gameofthrones,"A lot of people see this as him surrendering his honor, but in my eyes, this is one of the most honorable things he does. When Ned is in the dungeon, he is very against giving in and falsely confessing his crimes. He tell Varys that he is not concerned with his own life, and that he would sooner die than give up his honor. Even when Varys tell Ned that he can stop the civil war that Robb had started because of Ned's imprisonment, Ned refuses to give in. After Ned realizes that his daughters are still in the capital, and he had to protect them, he knew that what he had to do was give in, because his grater duty was to his family, not his own honor. Ned sacrificed his most important aspect of himself, and not only that, but thinks that he will live on for years as a traitor at the wall, in order to protect his family. This is why, in my opinion, this is the most honorable thing that I have seen any character do. Even though Ned may not be with us anymore, I take solace in knowing that the two people (Sansa and Arya) that he sacrificed his honor for are still alive."

2375,gameofthrones,Da Bears!
2376,gameofthrones,That's going right up on the fridge for sure.
2377,gameofthrones,I think Beric uses a shield...he had one when he fought the Hound...but that may just be a trial by combat thing because I think I remember the Hound having a shield too.
2378,gameofthrones,I wonder if you can claim insanity to get out of being Lord of Winterfell
2379,gameofthrones,you can tell by the way it is.
2380,gameofthrones,He forgot to touch up his roots 
2381,gameofthrones,"*no kills.

Stannis isn't dead. He is the rightful king and will take his throne."
2382,gameofthrones,The two of them were the original GoT power couple.
2383,gameofthrones,An “undertaking”?? Lol what? Naw it’s absolutely brilliant and one of the best shows of all time. Watch it ASAP.
2384,gameofthrones,"Honestly I thought Loras an Olenna were goners, and I was even more leaning on Olenna to go... Instead I still have the Queen of Thorns and lost the rest."
2385,gameofthrones,Damn that is freaking badass. 
2386,gameofthrones,~~FINISH THE BOOKS~~ Happy birthday GRRM!
2387,gameofthrones,"Kit Harrington also has noble blood though. His father is the current baronet of Ridlington and one of his ancestors was King Charles II of England.

Edit: Apparently both of them share ancestry from King Charles II which makes them distantly related to each other."

2389,gameofthrones,From a distance I was totally trying to figure out how Wun Wun wasn't the hybrid vampire warewolf from Underworld.
2390,gameofthrones,Littlefinger was the one who put on the show of the little people recreating the war of the five kings. He knew that Joffrey would act like the shithead that he was and it would enrage Tyrion which lead to the argument and Joffrey drunkenly telling Tyrion to pick up the mug that Queen Tyrell put poison in. 
2391,gameofthrones,This is a spoiler if you don't know what the eggs turn into
2392,gameofthrones,"Brilliant! Hope she never pushed you the wrong way whilst ringing her bell? I love this so much, not just for your costume, but I myself have a stick and needed a chair at times, I love to keep it fun and if people are going to look and stare, well let’s give them something.

You are the winner though, this is amazing."
2393,gameofthrones,"That’d be the best marketing ploy ever; get Kit Harrington or whoever to just drive home with it and just let the photos go viral. 

Not that they need to do much promo atm. "
2394,gameofthrones,You had me in the first half not gonna lie
2395,gameofthrones,"Not only that. At this point, Robb will be a power house. And who else hates the Lannisters? the Vale. At this point, they might be more inclined in joining Robb."
2396,gameofthrones,Right before he cut a deal with the Queen of Thornes to get Cersei thrown in the High Sparrow's dungeon.   Littlefinger will do what is in his best interests.  
2397,gameofthrones,And I don't think he stopped because he didn't want Sansa to see him kill Ramsey. I think he stopped because he knew he had to let Sansa finish the job.
2398,gameofthrones,"Hold the door!
Hold da door!
Ho da door!
Ho door!

RIP sweet prince, he held the door.
"
2399,gameofthrones,Sansa is really tall!
2400,gameofthrones,"> Jon bitterly sit on the throne  
  
Also if many other main characters die (like Sansa) and Jon is pretty much the only one major character left alive in the end... that would be bitter sweet cuz he's sort of undead.

"
2401,gameofthrones,I need photographic evidence of this.
2402,gameofthrones,"How is it cringe even in the slightest? Let me guess, you don't think Arya should have been able to over power Brienne?"
2403,gameofthrones,"Elia would probably die from another child, and also he thought thatbthe ""song of ice and fire"" would mean that TPWP would need to be of both Stark(ice) and Targaryen(fire) blood, so he had a child with Lyanna."
2404,gameofthrones,"I can't imagine why Petyr Baelish would know about Jon being Lyanna's son. Only Ned and Howland Reed would know for certain about Jon, and maybe House Dayne since Ned went there after he killed Arthur Dayne to return his sword. Littlefinger is smart, he knew Ned to be honorable to a fault and maybe guessed that Ned wouldn't cheat on his wife but nobody had any certainty that Lyanna was even pregnant in the first place. Perhaps Littlefinger is playing off of a hunch and will try to weave some lies, but I think it's more likely that he's trying to trick Jon into taking the Knights of the Vale to fight the Lannisters knowing full well that Daenerys is coming to overthrow anyone who claims to be a King in Westeros. Jon might be pissed A) because Littlefinger gave Sansa to the Boltons and B) because Jon knows there's a worse enemy to the North and sees through Littlefinger's bullshit. The only reason Jon hasnt executed Littlefinger yet is that he saved Jon at the Battle of the Bastards."
2405,gameofthrones,What would be his reward?!
2406,gameofthrones,Residing at Knight's King Landing
2407,gameofthrones,...and still hasn't finished the main quest
2408,gameofthrones,"In general, it's not a great idea if you are starting out a big epic story to go onto its reddit, or wiki page, or anything on the internet relating to that story."
2409,gameofthrones,"I loved him so much I was just straight up rooting for him, any scene he was in he just took over and that's exactly how Tywin should be."
2410,gameofthrones,"Did they actually cast him as Kraven? He could pull it off. I think Josh Brolin would be a better choice for both Kraven and Doom of course, but he can't play literally everything."
2411,gameofthrones,Euron inherited Ramsay's plot armor.
2412,gameofthrones,I mean if he was a magic ice revenant
2413,gameofthrones,"It's not constructive criticism. It's people looking for something to bitch about, but not being able to find anything. ""Lazy writing"" is right up there with the other two phrases I mentioned that piss me off to no end. I really just need to stay off this sub until after next week's episode. People have completely lost their minds on the theory vs. reality argument."
2414,gameofthrones,"It supports its weight but, being that it was my first one, I now know I definitely could have made it sturdier. 

My fiancé has it hanging on the wall near all his other GoT stuff so it wouldn’t matter in that sense if it was sturdy. "
2415,gameofthrones,He is such a little rascal. Can't get him to listen that one. 
2416,gameofthrones,"> First look a Euron

On a bridge that sways no less... 

> I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings"
2417,gameofthrones,"There are too many changes to the series, too many characters that should be dead or should still be alive.  he probably gave a basic idea for a ending, but I highly doubt it will be the same.

Not to mention he will probably take feedback from the shows ending into consideration for the remaining 2 books."
2418,gameofthrones,"It was the most satisfying episode they have ever had.

Greyjoy and Stormborn alliance.

Jon kicked so much ass and Sansa got her retribution, killing the most evil **** in GoT.

Loved it."
2419,gameofthrones,"Guys, can we get back to Emilia Clarke fooling reddit into thinking she's just a random cosplayer please."
2420,gameofthrones,"Isn't the history of what happened in the free hold pretty limited?

I guess maybe he should write more of those, would love to read that. "
2421,gameofthrones,"I also think he was wrong about Arya and Clegane switching roles in mercy and cruelty. Arya has been about *justice* for a long time now, and now that she has a way to execute justice (albeit in a cruel fashion) she's being compared to The Hound, who used to murder or steal just for his own sake (for instance, the father and daughter that were revisited in this very episode)."
2422,gameofthrones,Father always promised.
2423,gameofthrones,I think it's just an out of context photo of her superimposed 
2424,gameofthrones,"That was definitely lost on me, thanks for the insight there. One of the things I've realised from watching this show is how much I remember from watching the history channel in the days before it was the Hitler Channel. I've noticed a lot of medieval European military maneuvers and tactics but this was definitely not something I was aware of. "
2425,gameofthrones,"Arya could hook her up.

In all seriousness, if LSH is an actual thing... what if she takes on LF?"
2426,gameofthrones,"I hope he isn't dead. But honestly he has been gone for so long, that I'm not even sure bringing him back would be that cool. He had almost no screen time"
2427,gameofthrones,That's a possibility too. I think maybe the Others could've just wreck havoc and left only Targaryens (somehow)
2428,gameofthrones,[deleted]
2429,gameofthrones,I think this way is much slower but still have very predictable trajectory. For 80-level archer like Ramsay it is not big deal
2430,gameofthrones,Reading WoT really put me behind in the Horus Heresy... you have been warned 
2431,gameofthrones,Unrealistic because he is under contract not to tell anyone and the potential penalty is not worth the cost of a speeding ticket. If this guy went on twitter and it somehow got really big then Kit could get in trouble. 
2432,gameofthrones," The Bud Knight helmet looks strikingly similar to a Mandalorian helmet (Jango/Boba Fett). The upcoming SW show, The Mandalorian, is going to be led by Pedro Pascal. And this commercial referenced the scene where Oberyn (Pedro) gets his head crushed by The Mountain. Wow...this is DEEP! "
2433,gameofthrones,Better about the Tales of Dunk and Egg! I want to see the Red Widow!
2434,gameofthrones,They especially don't need it in Game of Thrones because the intro focuses on places rather than people.
2435,gameofthrones,"She stood over him while he was sleeping and kosh him in the head with a rock. She also stabbed him with Needle but it didn't go through his armor.

2440,gameofthrones,"Not sure if that's a joke about forgetting the Dorne plot, but didn't Doran die in Sunspear?"
2441,gameofthrones,100 hrs? Those are rookie numbers. 
2442,gameofthrones,That is precisely what I am saying. I don't think Margaery plans to confess or do the atonement. This smells like a trap through and through.
2443,gameofthrones,"But how many named more than one of their son's Aegon? I'm not complaining that he used an old family name for his son, but that he used the same name twice. There's plenty of other names they could have gone with.

Edit* Also, Frey isn't a good example because he's a completely different kind of person than Rhaegar. The fact that he has so many Walders in his family is played as a joke, not the culmination of an ancient prophecy."
2444,gameofthrones,"Ha! I bet you don't even give the full titles of Daenerys Targaryen, the First of Her Name Queen of Meereen,

2446,gameofthrones,You're amazing OP.  I hope there is more.
2447,gameofthrones,"I dont think its ever been said that the Weirwoods protected places, they werent rare at all until the First men came along and started chopping them down. It would seem likely that the Weirwoods have some power but the true protection would be from spells cast by the CotF and Greenseers I think."
2448,gameofthrones,"That moment of silence with her facial expressions....my god. Lena Headey is just an incredible actress, she has been great in many films but for me she has never fit a character so perfectly than Cersei Lannister."
2449,gameofthrones,My body is ready
2450,gameofthrones,"Well, it still makes a difference for a lot of people but maybe it was budget. 

Still, would have been nice if they found a better castle, but maybe that was a budget thing too. "
2451,gameofthrones,Dude something is wrong with your keyboard.
2452,gameofthrones,You can’t lose with a quote from Sean Bean’s Lord Eddard Stark. Let’s get it!

2454,gameofthrones,"They have apps for that kind of thing. Our mage uses it, it's really convenient."
2455,gameofthrones,Like how Jon Snow stayed dead right? 
2456,gameofthrones,The person I replied point was she took the nude scenes because she needed the role even though she has a big problem with doing nude scenes do you not see the parallel?
2457,gameofthrones,They're supposedly about 17 in season one per Catelyn's pleas to Ned in episode two.
2458,gameofthrones,"Well, according to GRRM he's one of the ""big five"" characters, but honestly, out of the five (Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Bran and Tyrion), he seems like the most expendable at this point in the show. If they're looking for an absurdly shocking death that still allows the story to progress relatively unhindered, it would most certainly be Tyrion. "
2459,gameofthrones,!RemindMe 1 day
2460,gameofthrones,I feel like Ramsay Bolton is the guy to ask for that job.
2461,gameofthrones,"A lot of people don't seem to realize this. Even the best actor can't save a shitty script.

Like, surely you guys have seen the Star Wars prequels? Sam Jackson, Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor. All pretty good actors right? Yet their performances were boring and forgettable because George Lucas."

2506,gameofthrones,"The reaction to the recent animated show trailer is hilarious. There’re thousands of grown men online complaining about how it’s not catered to them. I literally had someone reply to one of my comments saying that it’s insulting that Disney wouldn’t release something for an older age group. Like, do these people even understand what Star Wars is? They think it’s their GoT but really it’s always been a fun space romp for kids. "

Right... 

You know, when all you Stannis apologists obsessively argued the show wasn't going to burn Shireen because of this or that Stannis quote, or tiny shred of 'evidence,' I used to argue with you literally right up until an hour before the episode aired. Then it happened, and ya'll seemed to disappear really quick.

This time, I almost feel bad arguing with the few of you deranged enough to still hold that candle. I just feel like patting you on the top of the head and whispering ""It'll all be okay. Maybe you're right. Maybe the character you relate to the most isn't a monster."""

2549,gameofthrones,"I personally think actors are told to do this by the TV companies. Thinking back to pre-season 6 of The Walking Dead, in every interview, every lead actor said they lost their shit at the finale... It came and it wasn't *that* great - in fact, it's the lowest rated TWD episode to date.

However, I'm certainly not saying S7 of GoT won't be phenomenal, because we all know it will!"
2550,gameofthrones,"I agree. Pretty sure I saw Dolorous Edd in that room and another shot had Alliser Thorne standing behind a guy who was smashing a door, so I reckon Davos, Melisandre, and the few Night's watch guys who *didn't* hate Jon, are holding out with Jon's body and Davos is getting ready to fend them off."

2563,gameofthrones,He also describes Asha Greyjoy scoodly-pooping with some guy in detail and she's into the battering ram on his ship entering the eye of the storm. 
2564,gameofthrones,"I remember reading a blog post at least 10 years ago from an historical amour maker that said women in actual battle would not have ever worn 'boob shaped' armour - the sunken seamed area between 'steel boobs' would shatter your sternum if struck. Plus all those seams and extra shaping would have made it very weak structurally. 

Armour never hugged the body, it was a shell that was padded underneath and designed to reduce / spread the energy of blows by redirecting the energy of a strike from a single point to being spread and taken by the whole plate (dissipating the force), just like Kevlar/bulletproof vests do.


Boob armour is a fantasy invention. The armour Brienne wears is based on real / historical amour, and is designed with as few seams as possible for strength, plus deflects the energy of a strike around and to the sides instead of straight into the chest."

The sad realization that he was right when he said they'd be dead by winter but that he wished he was wrong. He was angry because all the criticisms about the world that he had seem to be verified when good people he says will die, do die, the way he says they will die... But he lives, because all the people he can't stand that tell him he's here for a reason, are probably right.  "

2573,gameofthrones,"Because Dragons and ice zombies are part of the explained internal logic of the magical world that GRRM created. This argument is not valid. However unless the amount of food necessary to sustain growth of a dragon is stated somewhere then one can easily assume ""magic""."

You know when you want to plug in an old Computer Screen, but your laptop only has a mini display port, so you have to use a display port to hdmi adapter, hook that up to hdmi>dvi and finally a dvi>vga adapter?

You're using a prosthetic>shoe adapter (the mold) followed by a foot>street adapter (the shoe) instead of directly going prosthetic>street."

2605,gameofthrones,Big bones is fat logic sure but don't discount thyroid and other diseases. 
2606,gameofthrones,isn’t it like 7 seasons? that’s an undertaking if each episode is 45-60 minutes. 
2607,gameofthrones,"It is, basically functions like a NSFW tag. If you have NSFW tags turned off idk if it will work the same way."
2608,gameofthrones,"I got out my Rap Air Horn app, paused the show for a minute, and went wild."
2609,gameofthrones,I think that this entire storyline is terribly written. I don't hate Ayra at all - I just think they are running out of time and rushing through things. 
2610,gameofthrones,This is what season one looked like compared to the quality we have now
2611,gameofthrones,littlefinger is my favourite character ad i hope the books make him a reckless good character rather than a naive plotter

Pretty sure that would fuck anybody up.


Edit: how is this at 200+ upvotes. it's just a possibly over simplified explanation of what the show runners intended. Bran accidentally fucked willis/Hordor over much like seemingly everything else he's done. "

2689,gameofthrones,"If nothing notable or extraordinary happens then why is it a story worth telling to begin with? I think you play fast and loose with the term deus ex machina. This is when the gods come to resolve the climax of the story for the heroes. What you've pointed out are the dragons that have been built up since the first season, and people making narrow escapes. If these characters didn't survive by narrow escapes they would be ""too powerful"", if no one had any luck and the hero's just died one after another then there wouldn't be much of a story to care about.

The Masters are so dead, caught between a sea of angry barbarians, and dragon-fire.  Dany is going to flip the board on all three of these cities.  Its capitulation or death, or less death.  The masters, had some mercy last time, now they will be finished.  Targs don't give third chances."

2753,gameofthrones,"The alliances aren't all about the Iron Throne.

You could argue they'd (Tyrells) value a slim chance of getting to have a queen higher than having a powerful ally, but having such an ally is the immediate advantage. Furthermore, depending on when such a deal would be made, having the North as an ally could potentially bring the Vale and Riverlands to the table as well whereas having the Riverlands, Vale or the Iron Islands wouldn't bring anyone else closer to them. Similarly, had they had any problems after their alliance by marriage with Tommen, it could have brought Stormlands and Westerlands to their cause.

This is obviously all hypotetical given I don't see any scenario where they would've liked different choices better than the ones they made. They're yet another case of Littlefinger's proverbial ladder."

I don't think Littlefinger wrote back to her. I think she left to go get him because she saw Jon's plan was useless and then saw that, fortunately, her Plan B to retake Winterfell worked out better than Plan A, which was to rally the Northern houses to her and Jon's side. "

2788,gameofthrones,honestly I feel like they'll be better off just dropping that plotline and letting some assassination attempt occur at the end of the season and have it tied to Dorne. Just let them operate in the background and we'll assume they somehow scooby-doo'd their way to exectuing a revenge plot. It's not like not showing the planning would be any worse than having to deal with those awful characters.
2789,gameofthrones,I thought the purpose of attacking the army line perpendicular was to create a hole for the dothraki to ride through.  You even see them using the gap in the episode.  The line falls apart if the enemy is both in front of and behind it.

Become a Wight: Arya

Is Dany Prego? Yes.

Who kills Night King? Bran (though Jon jumping from Rhaegal onto Viscerion and killing NK would be lit)

Who holds Iron Throne? Tyrion (By vote) and marries Sansa."

It's that the /r/thatHappened crowd is unable to let anyone take any joy whatsoever in *any* slightly outlandish story.

GoT has been so fun because of the rich history and it's largely unpredictable events (weddings and certain actions from Olly). 

The rebellion..we know what happened. We know Robert wins and kills rhaegar in what would presumably be the climax of the movie. It'd be cool but obvious and not as fun. "

Alternatively, it hasn't been spelled out specifically but with the whole ""Winter is Coming"" bit, I think it's implied the white walkers can't just go wherever they want. Maybe it has to be some level of cold/winter for him to go south, and as it gets colder he can go further south but it's not like he can just fly to Dorne right now if he wants to (or Essos). He has to move with the weather change."

2920,gameofthrones,"Why don't cosplayers ""dirty"" up their outfits? Make them actually look worn. It looks brand new here even though he was clearly going for a ""battle hardened"" look."
2921,gameofthrones,She was reading a text that Sam had already finished rewriting 
2922,gameofthrones,[deleted]
2923,gameofthrones,"It would be cool if they tried and failed, just so the ""resurrect everyone who dies"" thing stops"
2924,gameofthrones,Totally thought it would play out like that. Or Jamie would just stab her in the face in the last second.
2925,gameofthrones,That whole battle was traumatizing for *me* as a fan cause I liked everyone and didn't want either side to win... I can't imagine watching as your brother's army gets decimated by yours and then he tries to suicide himself to kill your queen... He must have felt pulled in all sorts of directions
2926,gameofthrones,https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=2fHlSkFsjVk
2927,gameofthrones,the commercial was shit. 
2928,gameofthrones,Do Lannisters know if Bran?
2929,gameofthrones,"Rad work, thanks.  Seeing the Hound dressed as a tommy-gun-wielding murderous thug made me want to see this same artist re-imagine the GoT characters as X-Men, as I also saw Wolvie in those eyes."
2930,gameofthrones,What's a stun double? 
2931,gameofthrones,"She did give him the right advice, she told him that Ramsay's a lot smarter than he thinks and that he should also give up on ever getting Rickon back alive. If Jon had taken that advice then he wouldn't have fallen into the trap."
2932,gameofthrones,Ned publicly said Joffrey was the rightful king and still got beheaded.
2933,gameofthrones,"Looks like a pale person more than a white walker to me. The body seems to have more bulk. I’m starting to buy into the theory of raised people in Winterfell, in this case one who haven’t hade time to decay much yet."
2934,gameofthrones,It's like a sequel to a game years later with updated graphics.
2935,gameofthrones,"Thats why you need Clagane and Tormund on the back line.  You can always bring them up into the box for set plays.  

I see Beric more as a box to box MF while Thoros is the holding MF."
2936,gameofthrones,"Well... when you notice something like that, a Wizard did it!"
2937,gameofthrones,She's blonde.
2938,gameofthrones,way before that
2939,gameofthrones,I love that she's kind of gotten  used to people groveling to her and worshipping over her so she only sees 2 sides of the coin. In her mind she's the rightfull heir to the 7 kingdoms and the iron throne and everyone either is with her or jelouse of her so therefore her enemy.  John comes in and he's like ok are you over yourself  now? I've got bigger problems and I don't really care who runs the kingdom as long as we take care of this shit. Then I'm gonna go away to live quietly somewhere and you all can continue your fight. She's not used to someone literally not being on either side of the coin and not giving a shit about her either way. 
2940,gameofthrones,Cersei is going to get an ass whopping for that!
2941,gameofthrones,"No way, that's Me!"
2942,gameofthrones,Wow I hate you! Good job!
2943,gameofthrones,"There's a real waterfall, Angel Falls, that's high enough to have a similar effect. I think Planet Earth featured it at some point; it's absolutely breathtaking."
2944,gameofthrones,"I just finished Book One but as a hardcore show fan having seen every season multiple times, there was a bunch of small foreshadowings that had me like OMG HE GAVE IT AWAY!! And it's just awesome to find those things given I know what happens already "
2945,gameofthrones,"I don't read the IaF books but from what I know, and what Sanderson himself has said he would be a terrible fit. Sanderson doesnt do brutality, sex, just the whole...visceral style of Westeros; and he writes worlds with high magic whereas magic in GoT is kind of more Tolkien style."
2946,gameofthrones,Did ya find the pilot episode?
2947,gameofthrones,"Wasnt he the one who kept meticulous records about the number of steps and his daily bowel movement schedules?

He was certainly busy!"
2948,gameofthrones,Awww. Thanks.
2949,gameofthrones,The @aol.com account. It’s over 10 years ago for sure. 
2950,gameofthrones,Tyrion snow. A bit on the short side
2951,gameofthrones,His Ratatta is top percentage!
2952,gameofthrones,"It would be a pretty ironic twist if the Lannisters gave him Harrenhal. He wants a castle so he gets the biggest one in Westeros. Which also happens to be unsustainable, poorly defendable and cursed. But hey, at least he's got a castle now."
2953,gameofthrones,You make me feel a failure at brooding about failure.
2954,gameofthrones,Are the required ingredients expensive?
2955,gameofthrones,Thank you! 
2956,gameofthrones,"For what it’s worth, only Rob is dead in the books. Rickon still lives. "
2957,gameofthrones,Wear that at every possible opportunity 
2958,gameofthrones,I'm not saying it's aliens.
2959,gameofthrones,Chaos is a ladder.
2960,gameofthrones,"It was a terrible play by LF. That is, if he actually wants Sansa. It would only makes sense if he didn't...but it seems like he does want her by his side so... doesn't make much sense for a great mastermind to screw up like that. Writers writing for drama, seems like it."
2961,gameofthrones,I demand trial by HR!
2962,gameofthrones,#BOOM BOOM CLAP
2963,gameofthrones,Not sure the title is too great considering Jon actually chose his duty over Ygritte when he ran back to Castle Black.
2964,gameofthrones,Seems a little large! Must have some big bills in there! Euros? Dollars? 
2965,gameofthrones,"She hates Boris Johnson too. Dislikes bearded men but does not growl at Jeremy Corbin. We say this too, just asked my husband, he said defo Trump, May and Boris without having a clue what I am on reddit for :)"
2966,gameofthrones,why is super mario still fat?
2967,gameofthrones,Spot On!
2968,gameofthrones,Those perfect books filled with minute details about every single meal the characters ever had.
2969,gameofthrones,High '5'. I hope the dragon slays the mountain
2970,gameofthrones,"The Clegane fight will happen, just might not be trial by combat. I don't remember him outlawing a trial of the seven either. I wouldn't be surprised if they fight in front of a fire with nobody else there to see it "
2971,gameofthrones,I see what you did there...
2972,gameofthrones,Could someone swinging a Valyrian steel sword damage his armor?
2973,gameofthrones,"Fuck, just seeing them together makes me kinda tear up. I mean, it's been 20 years since they split in the books. Praise the Old Gods for the show!"
2974,gameofthrones,Well that's fucking ages away.
2975,gameofthrones,Armor is sick man!
2976,gameofthrones,"Fuck the show. One thing I hate about it is that they make Tyrion’s drinking one of his main qualities, and ignore his main character, also the show watchers latch on to stupid quotes like: “I drink and I know things” and whatnot. Utter rubbish!"

2984,gameofthrones,I feel like a meme is a reference that is used so much that it becomes self-aware.
2985,gameofthrones,Still immoral and expensive. 
2986,gameofthrones,>Lemoncakes
2987,gameofthrones,Thank you very much!
2988,gameofthrones,I use the targaryan one for highlighter
2989,gameofthrones,Haha excellent my friend! Thank you and seven blessings to you
2990,gameofthrones,Iron-man is a Stark. 
2991,gameofthrones,For the record it's Joffrey. 
2992,gameofthrones,While they are arguing an ice zombie comes in and kills them all. 
2993,gameofthrones,ELIautistic might be better ffs
2994,gameofthrones,Magneto?
2995,gameofthrones,"I'm pretty sure words like ""impossible"" or ""illegal"" don't stop a man with the creep factor of Littlefinger"
2996,gameofthrones,Summer too. But not Ghost or Nymeria! 
2997,gameofthrones,"The fact that most characters have almost like theme music, and this became Cersei's is what makes it miles above the rest. It wasn't just a one off. 

Anybody else just think of that scene whenever they hear her 'theme'? It's like Rains of Castermere. "
2998,gameofthrones,God that hurts
2999,gameofthrones,"Marriage vows are also ""til death do us part."" Would Jon be free of his, if he were married?

For that matter, couldn't this work in our world too? ""Honey, I died on the operating table for 4 minutes during open heart surgery, so I'm ok to sleep with other women now!"""
3000,gameofthrones,"I think some sort of extreme retaliation was inevitable. Once Jonmhn and Danys alliance was cemented for example I half expected a dragon to poke its head into that hall and just roast the place, as an example."
3001,gameofthrones,I always say it Who too 😂😂
3002,gameofthrones,She's already lasted well over a week. She was crowned the day of the murder of the Tyrells. Since then Olenna travelled to Dorne and then Varys along with a Tyrell and Martell fleet travelled to Mereen and back a bit.
3003,gameofthrones,"Wait, he wanted to warg into Olly?"
3004,gameofthrones,"he is a proper dumb cunt
"
3005,gameofthrones,[deleted]
3006,gameofthrones,Arya <3
3007,gameofthrones,See this everyday as I walk to college!
3008,gameofthrones,"Yea, it definitely exists. [Here's an example](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Lannister) where a man takes his wife's name because her father (the king) had no male heirs.

Also, [this page]( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Customs) has a good explanation of how things work (the answer, much like real life - there aren't hard and fast rules, each individual situation gets worked out on its own)."
3009,gameofthrones,So he lives while Arya and Sansa die????? Ahhh this is too painful to think about. Arya must live!
3010,gameofthrones,Which scene is it?
3011,gameofthrones,"I agree, I learn so much by reading the comments on a lot of these threads, it's why I come here really...and well, because of the funny ones"
3012,gameofthrones,"I don't think there was anything he could do. The warging into him in the past by Bran, but using his body in the present, made the past Hodor convulse, but still try to hold the door (except it was the ground). Once he actually died in the future, his past self from that point forward was a slave to his destiny. Just as the virus is only intelligent enough to keep replicating, Hodor was only intelligent enough to serve Bran and because of the trans-dimensional entanglement he was subconsciously drawn to Bran. As far as Hodor's realization, yes I agree with you. It was only ever clear to him at that moment, but he knew of the pending demise from the moment of his ""seizure"". It seems a combination of stupified bliss is what acted as a sufficient distraction for all his years, leading up to his moment of reckoning. What a mindfuck."
3013,gameofthrones,"
Bruce Willis is dead in “The Sixth Sense.” And Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker’s Dad."
3014,gameofthrones,The fuck is with your username
3015,gameofthrones,"I mean, that and Rickon running in a straight line and somehow getting hit by the arrow. Just turn around, wait for Ramsay to shoot the arrow, watch where the arrow is going and move away from that location. It takes like a full 3 seconds to reach your location.

Getting hit by an arrow at 300 yards is harder than not getting hit by it. Ramsay Bolton is not Robin Hood.

 It's so ridiculous it would have ruined the episode had the fight not been so dope."
3016,gameofthrones,"God yeah, I went to school with a girl who had her first child at 16 and named her Khaleesi, I don't even think she actually spelled the name correctly. Lovely lass but bloody hell."
3017,gameofthrones,"I did too! But after this point people say she is so unemotional and that she's a bad actress for some reason :/  (again, OTHER PEOPPE SAY THIS. I think she is an amazing actress, no need to downvote me for loving Emilia Clarke, guys)."
3018,gameofthrones,Maybe Transformers 5 will have a character who has it printed on a laminated card.
3019,gameofthrones,"People in the books constantly remark that Drogon is Balerion the Dread reborn. But then people on the show keep referring to them as ""full grown dragons."" I hope you're right though. I'd love to see a dragon the size of a literal mountain. However, Balerion's skull on the show was only about Drogon's size, so I don't think he'll get much bigger."
3020,gameofthrones,Just like his daddy 😢
3021,gameofthrones,">Ned would have approved of Sansa writing that letter, and they both know it.

I hope that's the case. "
3022,gameofthrones,"Eh, in the books the brothers were right to mutiny against Jon. He was going to break his oaths and march on Winterfell, and he requested that the men of the Night's Watch follow him and break their own vows. His death in the show was fucking bogus, but his death was pretty just in the books; breaking the Oath of the Night's Watch is punishable by death."
3023,gameofthrones,WEDDING HYPE 
3024,gameofthrones,"That top one looks like a Christian contemporary band.

""Praise Her Name""  

""Her Love Sustains Us""

""Praise Her Some More""

""Rain Your Justice And/Or Mercy Down Upon Us, Khaleesi, Whichever Is Appropriate""

""Just Generally Praise, Really""

""Praise-y PraisePraise"""
3025,gameofthrones,"I think it was because he respects her so much, and she was willing to give up even her honor, the only thing she ever had (or so she believes), for this cause. It makes a bad parallel when he goes to his sister, which has only ever cared about herself, and showed that wasn't going to change in any way. It helps too that the whole season they've been showing him getting grumpy about having to talk about her. He was already on his way out, but fighting it for the sake of his honor. Then Brienne of Honor tells him ""fuck honor"""
3026,gameofthrones,Now *that* looks to be made from a thousand swords.
3027,gameofthrones,When I buy stuff from the PlayStation store it come with all the Blu-ray extras. 
3028,gameofthrones,"I heard about this ages ago and tried my damndest not to see it.... Now I can't unsee it, someone please in tbe editing room fix this pleaasssee"
3029,gameofthrones,I mean you can drink the kool-ade if you wish
3030,gameofthrones,Although the point of the first two rules of fight club was reverse psychology so that they could get more members.
3031,gameofthrones,"I don't know. I never thought so when reading the books or watching the show.

I considered it it more of a veil than a mask."
3032,gameofthrones,"As more of a causal fan, I was hoping he would cover what the theories are for what Lynanna whispered to Eddard before she died. She definitely didn't say Jon, but you could clearly see her lips so I thought there would be some ideas about what she really named him. I haven't seen any discussion of this, but the show clearly made a big deal of making his real name just barely indistinguishable so I would assume it is significant whatever it is. "
3033,gameofthrones,"He was with ned though, even if he wasn't in the tower itself. It's not like he'd believe that Ned just walked out of the tower where they were reaching Lyanna with Ned's bastard son; it's be fairly obvious what really happened and I don't think Ned Lord to him about that. I agree that we won't be seeing much, if any, of him in the show."
3034,gameofthrones,"When I left my comedy group in college, I worked “cunt” into my sendoff sketch by using the phrase “how can I work the word ‘cunt’ into a sketch.” The joke being I never use the word around others (it’s in my private cursing repertoire) and I was literally writing the sketch wondering how to work the word “cunt” into a sketch, so I just put that thought into the lines.

Troupe thought it was hilarious, everyone else I know not so much."
3035,gameofthrones,Excuse me?
3036,gameofthrones,If the story goes this fast next episode we will see dany and jon's son. the prince who was promised 
3037,gameofthrones,"All hail Jon of the House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. "
3038,gameofthrones,"Beating a really dead horse here but Firefly's dialogue is some of the most natural sounding speech I've ever heard in a TV show or film outside of Deadwood. You can *hear* Whedon in every character, but they all very much have their own voices and the sentence structure never sounds tortured even though it probably should. Still marvel about it when I re-watch.

That said, he really could have learned a few new tricks between now and then. Whedon just sounds like Whedon now, back then it was original and interesting."
3039,gameofthrones,No mid-tier or higher character deaths
3040,gameofthrones,Then he would have to do tormunds face when he smiled at Brianne 
3041,gameofthrones,"This is hilarious, but try to keep away from browsing the web until you finish season 5, for the web is dark and full of spoilers"
3042,gameofthrones,"This more elvish, narrow faced look is what I thought she would look like as I was reading the novels. "
3043,gameofthrones,"Think about it from a practical view point. It takes a long time for a fat guy to become skinny from lack of food. Many , many months if not a year depending on how big the guy is. 

&#x200B;

If Sam lost that much weight then every regular sized man in the group would be long dead from lack of food since they didn't have his ""reserves"" to keep them alive. "
3044,gameofthrones,"Next episode is called the Queen's Justice. The King's Justice used to be Ilyn Payne, guess the new one is the mountain. Isn't the one sandsnake left alive also the one who wanted to ""meet"" the mountain? This should be good."
3045,gameofthrones,"If he lives that close to the wall, and can't trust the watch to keep his village safe, why does he trust them enough to join them? They obviously suck at their main job."
3046,gameofthrones,Gaaaalllaaaaavaaaaaaant!
3047,gameofthrones,Amazing is just too little to describe what you just achieved....  His facial expressions are just too real.....
3048,gameofthrones,"Thanks! My derp.

Funnily enough the etymology for *scold* is from the Old Norse word *skáld*, while *scald* is Latinate, from *excaldare*!

If only Middle English had retained the Norse spelling, I could be right..."
3049,gameofthrones,ha ha ha!!!  Agree!
3050,gameofthrones,Ellia definitely died in the books.
3051,gameofthrones,"Actually pretty lady makes a pretty good curse for someone engaged to the crazy King. Married the Kings dwarf uncle. Later gets married off to a sadistic bastard (former bastard anyway). So I think that statement qualifies as relevant too. She really has become a player. And so much tougher too. I can't help but think of Jaime saying ""in my experience girls like her don't live very long"" and how much she has changed since Jaime last saw her. "
3052,gameofthrones,"Have an uplittlefinger, sir."
3053,gameofthrones,"You may want to read the Great Southern Conspiracy theories... Rickard Stark seemed to really want to strike a lot of alliances with other southern lords like Arryn, Baratheon, and Tully for some reason, which was very unusual for the North. "
3054,gameofthrones,"I enjoyed how both Jamie and Sansa, the ""slowest learners"" of their family, both had their breakthrough tonight."
3055,gameofthrones,Well how about Catelyn? What a fox.
3056,gameofthrones,He's living up to his name
3057,gameofthrones,Oh for sure I hope you're right. This show has just got me thinking about worst case scenarios haha 
3058,gameofthrones,"I disagree.  Look at what he does to Septa Unella or the interaction when the Hound finally runs across him again.  Those are Mountain things, not undead random monster things.

There's definitely a good deal of the Mountain still there.  Just like Lady Stoneheart encompasses a good deal of Catelyn in the books.
"
3059,gameofthrones,"Maybe, but I think it is a lot worse than it could have been"
3060,gameofthrones,Gendry and Hot Pie? 
3061,gameofthrones,"I think it's random people, but Nymeria is still loyal to the Starks. After the Red Wedding she recognizes Catelyn's body floating down the river, rushes to get her out, and then tries to revive her.

Technically Arya was warging into Nymeria at the time but almost all of the Stark kids, including Bran up until he learned how to control it, don't realize they're warging into their animals so the wolf's latent personality takes over."
3062,gameofthrones,Imagine trying to jack off 
3063,gameofthrones,I feel the same way. But then I remember how much I need the bad poosi.
3064,gameofthrones,"Can confirm. Complete lack of chill. 

Edit: last night I screamed ""This is it! This is my moment! My purpose has shown itself!""

Edit 2: GOLD??? Why thank you:)"
3065,gameofthrones,"She's interesting because she bounces back at Tyrion proving he doesn't know everything. And you root for Tyrions success, but the pages to screen transfer leaves you wanting more. 

And the death scene is so much more emotional, tyrion is doing it in self defense in the show, but from what I recall in that chapter Shae is happy to see tyrion and during an embrace he snaps for everything she did to him. 

I can't remember if he see's through he act, or what it was, but sudden she's dead, he blames his father for it all, and then settles a long outstanding score. "
3066,gameofthrones,Good work!
3067,gameofthrones,Don't click on this link. It's used for AD revenue.
3068,gameofthrones,"And the modern fade haircut looks really out of place.

Edit: To everyone replying ""but they had this hair in the 30s!!!!!!"" I fucking get it. You're not the only people who have seen pictures from the 1930s. Notice how I didn't mention Ramsey's hair, which is a similar undercut style but fits that era? Jon's hair looks exactly like its from a [2010s boy band](http://nextluxury.com/wp-content/uploads/buzzed-modern-hairstyles-for-men.jpg). I cannot find a single picture of a person from that era with hair combed like this."
3069,gameofthrones,"Slightly tangential here but [this is a spinnaker sail.](https://i.imgur.com/l8yefln.jpg) They are colorful and come with fun designs sometimes. 

If I ever win the lotto, I want to get a spinnaker made with the Bolton crest on it. Imagine showing up to the weekly regatta and whipping that out?! "
3070,gameofthrones,This is the art historical answer 
3071,gameofthrones,"yes... an unnecessary act of kindness and appreciation when these days, at least in america, all we see are hate greed and narcissism.. and america seems to prefer it that way"
3072,gameofthrones,At least it wasn't home schooling
3073,gameofthrones,"Just watched that episode a couple of days ago. 

“He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.”

"
3074,gameofthrones,technically this story is A Song of Ice and Fire. 
3075,gameofthrones,Yeah that's kinda a deal breaker for me.
3076,gameofthrones,**I SAW**
3077,gameofthrones,">The Winds of Castemere

Rains of Castemere*"
3078,gameofthrones,"Ah, yes, that’s the Children of the Forest, then. That scene was at the end of season 4/beginning of 5 if I recall correctly. The flaming balls would ignite as a Child threw them, so surely that’s what you’re thinking of."
3079,gameofthrones,30 miles from my house. Where was my invite?!? 
3080,gameofthrones,"Don't worry. It breathes fire, but it's a Tesla flamethrower, so there's no real danger as long as your at least a foot away. "
3081,gameofthrones,"Since the beginning of time. As I wrote no one has to go for a specific character--stormtrooper suits aren't cheap but they're the perfect anonymous costume. Even then if you're *too short* or whatever you're opening yourself up for those comments. 

Turned on its head, do you take issue when someone nails a look perfectly, of say Danaerys or whoever? Does pointing 
 that out seem inappropriate? 

At the time of my first seeing this yesterday, no one was being snarky or making any sort of crack about anyone's appearance. While Samwell is overweight in the show, a lot of that is clothing/armor, and to be honest he is one of the most universally beloved GoT characters. 

Be careful about shutting people down when they are on their best behavior. OP has every right to dress up as the Hound, Joffrey, Cersei, the Night King, or whoever he likes. That doesn't limit the crowd to saying ""bravo"" regardless of the outcome (which would be quite patronizing). 

I too think OP with his current facial hair and hairstlye and eyes looks a hell of a lot like Sam. And Sam is a great character. "
3082,gameofthrones,poop is laddah
3083,gameofthrones,"> It's not talked about much in the show

He does actually talk about this in the show. It is a real quick part of it but I know all of the above because of the show. "
3084,gameofthrones,Personally I thought he was more tragic than anything else. He's a kid and gets suckered into believing Jon is the bad guy.
3085,gameofthrones,"Gods damn it, I hoped that she was doing something clever that I didn't think of. But no, she ran back to Littlefinger and did EXACTLY what he wanted."
3086,gameofthrones,The Mountain doesn't strike me as the kind of guy to stab someone in the eye with a dagger though.
3087,gameofthrones,"I tried it last night and liked it, it’s a pretty nice sipping whiskey but if you don’t like whiskey you probably won’t care for it. "
3088,gameofthrones,Olly...GOAT!
3089,gameofthrones,Read the title
3090,gameofthrones,"""A song of Smirnoff ice"" sounds like a terrible story. "
3091,gameofthrones,Umbreon
3092,gameofthrones,"Someone did do an edit with their swords being light sabers and Jon shooting lighting out of his fingers

"
3093,gameofthrones,Real shit¿
3094,gameofthrones,I guess I could carve that above Stark in smaller letters.  What do you think?
3095,gameofthrones,"In HBO logic, they'll just conveniently have 100,000 wool cloaks laying around, ready for daenarys army. They'll acclimate with zero problems"

3103,gameofthrones,"> In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it,’ says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it,’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do it,’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me – who lives and who dies?  
> -Varys

Power is legitimate as long as you have the support to keep it. If R+L=J, you could say Jon was the rightful heir to Aerys and Rhaegar, but that doesn't mean he's got any legitimate claim to rule. Danaerys believes the throne is hers by right, but if Jon is Rhaegar's heir, she has no claim (succession falls to the oldest living male first). But would Jon fuck around with the dragons? Stannis and Robb tried to take the throne by force, and eventually died for it. Tommen is a Baratheon in name only, and his reign is maintained by Lannister gold. The faith militant wields power through both the sword and the common folk. It's unlikely they could take the throne, but they wield tremendous influence regardless.

As much as we'd like to believe that our favorite character is the true and rightful king/queen, power is a fickle bitch. Ellaria may not be highborn or married into the Martell family, but she has the support of her people, which is enough to hold and wield power in Dorne, at least for now. "

3105,gameofthrones,Can I just point out how Cersei looked when the wight ran towards her? She looked fucking scared shitless.

If Tyrion would have stopped whoring and drinking I contend Tywin would give him a lot more respect because he did see Tyrion's potential. He probably treats Tyrion harshly because he subconsciously blames him for his wifes death

I would argue it's Tywin's treatment of Tyrion right from birth that drove the latter to whoring and drinking. If he could have abated his hatred for Tyrion enough to not try and execute him, the Lannisters would still be in power."

3220,gameofthrones,"I was most def not referring to the tv adaptation of ASOIF - which is also arguably a genre game changer, but due to the limitations of the film platform is certainly considerably scaled back from the books. As many have said before me, it would be half impossible and prohibitively expensive to adapt MBOTF to film in a way that would do the books any justice (at least w today's tech - who knows what things will be like 10 yrs from now). 

Regarding the books however, I think Erikson without a doubt rivals GRRM in scale, but I don't think he CONSISTENTLY (key word) matches the level of detailed immersion in the story.  When recounting the chain of dogs for example, I thought Erikson held his own against just about anything found in ASOIF, at least thus far. In other parts however, he seems to wander a bit more in his writing or left me with less visceral feeling and disciplined attn to detail, and a more archetypal Tolken-esk story line (examples that come to mind include some of the parts involving the events in Lethar, and at least book 1 of DoD). 

At the end the day however, this is merely the opinion of one moderately well read (huge) fan of both series. I'm sure there are some who completely disagree - and that's perfectly ok. 

One thing I definitely have to credit Erickson for is not stretching the story out over 23+ yrs (realistically ASOIF might not be completed w/in 3 decades if he GRRM keeps up the pace he's been treading along at for the last book or 2) - I'm in the group who is slightly worried the series might not ever see a complete ending with a quality consistent w that found through the series thus far.

3303,gameofthrones,Rickon isnt dead in books. But who knows if those will ever be finished.
3304,gameofthrones,"If GoT was a Spanish speaking show,  and in that show Hodor's name was Solata,  and then you watched that scene, would you be confused? I think it still works just so long as they are still listening to the audio and not exclusively reading the subtitles or watching it dubbed. "

3319,gameofthrones,">I just don't know how you can say that and think you're being logical about the whole situation. How on earth would you know the amount of effort GRRM is putting into finishing this series.

We know the reality. Yeah, we don't know what's going on in his head, but we can damn well sure judge his actions. And his actions CLEARLY say the books aren't a priority for him anymore. Now I won't get into if that's fair to the readers or not, that's a different conversation, but it is unquestionable they are no longer his priority. If they were, he would have already released TWOW. It really is as simple as that"

3349,gameofthrones,"Her left eye look wonky as fuck. Should be moved slightly to the center to match her other eye.

3350,gameofthrones,"That was such a stupid complaint. He only said to remind everyone that he is smart, such a bitch."
3351,gameofthrones,"Someone commented something similar which sparked this in my head. I think it is genius but way too subtle for these writers to be doing.  LF obviously knows who the faceless men are. And he watched Arya use the dagger in her fight with Brienn, so he knows she has it. For LF to meet his demise without the Vale abandoning Sansa/Jon, something needs to happen where LF betrays the North publicly.  The writers have also been hinting that the Northern lords are starting to view Sansa as their leader. Arya admits she is a faceless man and threatens Sansa loudly, which could possibly be overheard, maybe even by a lurking LF. Arya even explicitly says she just needs Sansa's face and can see what it's like being Lady Stark.  If LF was listening, that's the last thing he hears. 

Now here's the payoff. LF did not see Arya hand over the dagger to Sansa. If he knows that Arya threatened to kill Sansa and take her face, maybe the next time he sees Sansa walking around with the dagger he will think it is Arya who carried out her threat and killed Sansa, especially if Arya isn't seen around Winterfell.  Maybe it worries him enough that he talks to the other lords about overthrowing/killing Sansa because he thinks it's really Arya, or even challenges Sansa publicly (like Ned did to Cersei). Then it comes crashing down when Arya shows up next to Sansa, and claims that LF had just been trying to manipulate the North to gain power and the iron throne.  The Lords side with Starks, LF gets his due in a similar way to how Ned was killed/betrayed in S1 (maybe even with Arya holding the dagger to his throat from behind), continuing the mirroring going on between the current storylines and previous storylines. 

But, again, I think it's too subtle for the writers, and they probably would have needed to show LF lurking outside the room for it to be pulled off effectively. Oh well. "

It has fucking *everything* and the way that it all connects and weaves together and builds up and pays off, the way the characters grow and develop and fulfill roles in the story, even the very minor ones, the worldbuilding. The way the story is framed broadly, with Winter slowly arriving and the walkers with it- and narrowly, with interpersonal stories between a variety of characters... GRRM is a living fucking god, I honestly have nothing. I really hope this isn't the last adaptation we see of this story, it deserves to be revisited and reinterpreted for years and years. "

Jamie: Come on now, seriously?  I can hear you breathing. 

Alright, fuck this. I'm out.

"
3484,gameofthrones,"Wait, so Brienne is only there to be the object of Tormund's lust now? Because that's funny given that Tormund is the one whose scenes have been eaten up the most by this joke. Brienne's haven't even acknowledged it since he left Winterfell, and barely before that. If anything it's the other way around.

Frankly I disagree this is even a representation issue in the first place, but if we go down that argument then:

>There are so many different men, but that isn't the same for women. You know this is true, don't fuck around and say it isn't.

Not in general it isn't. Maybe it's just the variation in my tastes, but I'd be confident in saying I could name as many male as female characters if listing only those who I feel are well written and three dimensional.

Which brings me to:

>Game of Thrones isn't a ""men's show"" either, you're insulting everyone by saying it is. Why insult yourself like that

>and wait...what the hell? you're bringing up... shoujo mangas? What the fuck does that have to do with anything? 

Game of Thrones is ultimately just fanfic of the actual series, an adaptation of a series of low fantasy books. And if you don't think the audience for such books is predominantly male then you're living in a fantasy land. Bringing up shoujo manga is the same kind of example of chick flicks, or sentai shows, or superhero comics. 

Some kinds of media are targeted at specific audiences and hence tailored to that audience. Asking them not to be that way is ultimately just asking for the creators to cater to a minority of their fanbase and makes no sense.

I understand the frustration of this, likely a lot better then you do if your only complaint is a lack of female characters. I mean you try finding decent ace characters. Forget decent, there are barely any characters full stop.

However sometimes frustrating things are that way for a reason and it just has to be accepted. "

""And just who, *pray tell*, are you?""

""Why, pray tell, are you volunteering for death by dragonfire?""

3535,gameofthrones,So what is the meaning of Jon Snow having no socks? Was it written that The Prince that Was Promised would have no socks because it displays his contempt for the White Walkers and the chilly ankles they bring?
3536,gameofthrones,Wow. Fuck Cersei
3537,gameofthrones,Lol yes. I just remember the description being that he has dark black arm and chest fur

3540,gameofthrones,One of the kings guard had to convince jamie not to intervene when the king was violently raping his wife. Jamie made the point they are supposed to protect the queen. The kingsguard responded that they don't protect her from him. How honorable can you be if you allow your king to be a monster? Jamie put him down. He held more honor and did what the others found to difficult to do.

3549,gameofthrones,"Sansa Stark-Lannister-Bolton, Queenindanorf."
3550,gameofthrones,"It was a game of faces. Sansa was supposed to tell if she was lying or not.

Arya is just *acting* like she's fighting with Sansa. Probably to convince *someone else* that they're fighting."
3551,gameofthrones,I could see her and Jamie dying together.  But I'm pretty sure Jamie will die by his sisters hand. 
3552,gameofthrones,I think we should stop predicting things and just let ourselves be surprised.

3568,gameofthrones,"I would argue that they use a system we are not familiar with at all. I doubt that their language would develop in the exact same way as modern English(there was no Greek or french or Latin or old Norse, etc) so it makes sense that their system of measurement would be different too. They only reason they speak English is to make it a lot simpler to understand because we don't know those languages. Not to mention that they are speaking with a modern English interpretation of 14th century English and not ""period accurate"" English. The reason languages like Dothraki arent in English is because ASoIaF is written from a 'westerosi' perspective. If you think about it this happens a lot in stuff like Star Wars or Dune."

Just look at the Leprechaun, which was originally a faerie like creature, but later changed into an irish stereotype to deride the group.                       
Basically, gingers were associated with Irish, Irish were treated poorly, and it sort of persists. "

To be fair these newcomers usually play the ending with the Extended Cut installed and therefore don't experience the hollowness that were the original endings. The ones with almost no explanation of anything whatsoever, with the nihilistic implications, where the only visual difference was the color used, and where the game stops rather than ends. It's not as bad for them as it was for people back when the game was released. (good for them, too!)"

3633,gameofthrones,How is Cersei purely evil? She's done less fucked up things then half the characters on the show. Jaime literally tried to murder a child for catching them have sex and killed his own cousin. Cersei has always been motivated by the love for her children and Jaime.
3634,gameofthrones,Noticed that also..I thought also he was judging by his previous arrows.   I know more dark but I would think why not just start flaying Rickon in front if everyone?  I think he will end up still charging or something.
3635,gameofthrones,">I like how Tywin wasn't even a full blown villain, everything he did was just to benefit his house. Even if he was antagonistic towards Tyrion you could still empathise with his actions.

3720,gameofthrones,"Some people would complain early on that Emilia Clarke wasn't a good actor. Like she showed no emotion but this woman is always laughing and so damn happy over everything. Dany is a pretty stone cold character, maybe even more than Jon and it's the farthest thing from her real self.

There is a blooper from last season where she kind of slides on set. It's like 1 second she is Dany and then another she's Emilia when she burst out laughing. "

3731,gameofthrones,"""Synthesis"": All humans, wights, and walkers, are forcibly turned into a human/WW hybrid. Functionally immortal, intelligent, and mostly with independent thought. Though kinda ugly and shriveled with glowing blue eyes. BUT no one wanted this. The story is resolved through forced integration instead of the proper resolution we've been working towards. Considered the ""best"" ending by the showrunners even though everyone else hates it and thinks it's stupid. The popular fan theory being that the Night King brainwashed the main cast to believe this was a victory, when really it accomplishes every goal he had been planning for and the humans had been fighting against.

""Control"": Somehow dominate the mind of the night king, functionally enslaving the Wights and White Walkers. Society ""flourishes"" with this influx of maintenance free labor (though in the short term many peasants starve from being put out if work and abandoned by their lords instead of being included in the new wealth), despite the fact that it is built on the idea of humans being within spitting distance of the unnatural abominations that could regain independence and finish the genocide of the living at any moment. Widely seen as a cowardly cop out and as a play in which the Night King is actually controlling YOU behind the scenes.

""Destruction"": Obliterate the White Walker scourge! Wipe their existence off the face of the universe! All White Walkers and Wights dissolve into nothing. The threat is over. The current doom is averted. Life goes back to the way it was before. Not perfect, but as it should be. The writers consider this the ""bad"" ending, even though it accomplishes all of the goals of the hero's in the safest and most complete way possibpossible, and is what everyone has been rooting for for years to begin with."

3733,gameofthrones,I think you’d make a good Xaro Xhoan Daxos
3734,gameofthrones,I think the most significant visual changes were aging people up. Modern audiences don't really want to see 14 year olds in a GOT world. Some of the scenes are difficult enough but if the characters looked younger I think more people would be turned off from the show.

3740,gameofthrones,"As in, it wouldn't have been a clean victory. He needed a clean victory to prove that he was the superior fighter. Nobody would consider him the better swordsmen if he needed help taking Ned down. 

He probably would have killed Ned, yes, but only if it was in honorable single combat. There'd be no honor in striking down a wounded man which means he wouldn't have been considered a superior fighter. "
3741,gameofthrones,"Yea it looks like it
https://imgur.com/a/DxYmd0n"
3742,gameofthrones,"Exactly. I've operated on the assumption that roughly the same number of years pass in show as are passing in real life, perhaps slightly less, mainly so that we don't have to pretend that the kids are a lot younger than their actors. This means that in the 6 years since episode 1, we can plausibly pretend that Tommen did in fact age from 8 or 9 to 14 or 15, even with the recast. The only place I know of where that doesn't match up well is that Sansa is 13 in S01E01, but is still only 14 by the middle of season 3 when she marries Tyrion."

3750,gameofthrones,"They thought it was Catelyn and Brienne, it says so in the books"
3751,gameofthrones,"I'm with you. I also think even if TWOW releases in the next couple years, we will never get ADOS. The show will have already revealed the ending. All the hype will be gone. He's already got plenty of money. So he's gonna spend what are probably his last 10 years alive writing the final book? Nope."
3752,gameofthrones,"They aged a lot of people on purpose. 

The most vivid example I can think of is they re-cast Tommen completely so that Natalie Dormer wasnt seducing and fucking 10 year old on television. 

The funny thing is the new Tommen was originally one of the random Lannister children that died a season or two prior. "
3753,gameofthrones,"Huh, TIL. I thought this stuff would be handled via an HBO account or via a talent agency contracted to supply extras. "

3911,gameofthrones,"Let’s talk about the book...
Please live long GRRM"
3912,gameofthrones,I thought size/height because Khal Drogo was so massive?
3913,gameofthrones,"Kit and Emilia are the 'leads,' who are given more time (even if it's just a few more scenes) than other characters/actors.
Lena, Nickolaj and Peter are the 'supporting,' who are given slightly less screen time. But overall they all get paid more than the others. But it doesn't mean you could nominate Lena, Nickolaj and Peter for 'leads' since they are under supporting."
3914,gameofthrones,I thought there were words written in the lines of the rose drawing. Maybe I saw too much.

3921,gameofthrones,The great wall of Lego. The Night Watch would have a hard time protecting these lego walls.

3923,gameofthrones,I read that in Tyrion's voice. 
3924,gameofthrones,Possibly. But they can have fairly narrow snouts

3926,gameofthrones,I think he just sailed around the south end of Westeros. I don't think we have any information on what's west of Westeros

3928,gameofthrones,Pretty sad how 6/8 were murdered...
3929,gameofthrones,"Yeah no, he's somersaulted up his own ass"
3930,gameofthrones,The thing I like about that is that it shows just how German the Berlin Wall really was. 
3931,gameofthrones,No hesitation. Brilliant. 
3932,gameofthrones,"Wow, he certainly fits the bill. In the show he's about every bit bit as bad as you'd imagine the actual Caligula to act and behave. Although, I think you'd have to be an awful person to be assassinated by your our secret service detail (praetorian guard). "

3934,gameofthrones,Hbo showing season 1 right now.
3935,gameofthrones,No... *Now he tends.*
3936,gameofthrones,Whoa! Do you still have the email? That is amazing hahaha
3937,gameofthrones,I remember hearing Jaime talking about Theon's uncle burning Lannisport early on. Of course he could be talking about Damphair but I don't think that's inline with his character as a priest.
3938,gameofthrones,I read that as my uncle married my aunt and I thought you were making a joke. 
3939,gameofthrones,He’s not named anything in the books. That hasn’t been revealed. Jaehaerys is a fan theory.
3940,gameofthrones,"the artist is amazing, she also did one of [jon snow](https://twitter.com/samiahdagher/status/903177035882921984). even more impressive"

3944,gameofthrones,"He doesn't care or want to finish it, you cannot force art out, if the artist is not willing, you'll get shit.

Perhaps he lost interest, run into a corner which he cannot continue the story without teleporting characters as the show, etc

Just let it be"
3945,gameofthrones,He'll probably distance himself as much as possible. That way he can see what works and what doesn't and finish the books accordingly. Just a hunch. 
3946,gameofthrones,"somehow i aint catching scurvy, somehow i aint catching scurvy "
3947,gameofthrones,"Bullshit, GRRM has never shied away from a dick opportunity."
3948,gameofthrones,Not just Thorne. Qhorin Halfhand.
3949,gameofthrones,This is the best one of the episode recap.
3950,gameofthrones,"This is bad for the show.
After 2 years people will have very high expectations and if the ending is a bad one GOT will get a lot of bad reviews for sure.

It can go from ""greatest tv-series"" ever to ""what a fucking joke/I waited 2 years for this shit"" very quickly."

3957,gameofthrones,"I've never understood how people say Theon is hot. I'm a straight dude so my judgement may be off, but IMO he's the least attractive one of the lot lol"
3958,gameofthrones,Yeah. The books don’t have a CGI budget to worry about.  The show had to decide...dire wolves or dragons.  
3959,gameofthrones,Dota Memes in the wild?
3960,gameofthrones,"This has been discussed before. That's Jon's excuse. However, I don't think the original Night's Watch brothers who made up the vows accounted for people getting resurrected. The whole idea behind the Night's Watch is ""this is it, this is all you are now"". "
3961,gameofthrones,"This is Aegon Targaryen, He's King. We're real proud of him and he's a Right Proper Lad. "
3962,gameofthrones,"You know, like, when you touch a woman's breast, and like, you touch it, and it feels like a bag of sand?"

3977,gameofthrones,betting you struggle to make rent each month
3978,gameofthrones,I'm pretty sure it was when Jon came back to life. 
3979,gameofthrones,"There is also a video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrNjy97M5vI

Going full Disney ;)"
3980,gameofthrones,I did the same and wasn’t sure what reason would that be. 
3981,gameofthrones,Wayne's World.
3982,gameofthrones,"jon was born being protected by arthur dayne aka the sword of the morning. The Dayne house sigil is a star/comet and a sword. Arthurs sword ""Dawn"" was forged from a fallen star. So while jons being born he is under the protection of a star (dayne or his sword) and dayne ends up dieing (definitely plenty of bleeding in the show death scene) i think Ned even kills him with his own sword. voila we have: Born under (the protection of) a bleeding star.
I think thats more fitting than the fact Ned sits a bloody sword at the end of Lynna's bed after the birth, although the imagery of the sun depicted on the Swords hilt as it rests on the bed is probably required for the TV show seeing as Arthur dayne's death was much earlier in the season."
3983,gameofthrones,Starks against humanity
3984,gameofthrones,Her with short hair and that fucking crown makes her look like a bigger bitch than before. 
3985,gameofthrones,"I don't know about starving; pretty sure they would have had food. 

If Gendry was sent back to the wall on the first day of travel, it's not unreasonable. Dragon travel speed is a bit of an unknown quantity. 

It could have been explained better but it's not so much illogical as it is poorly depicted. "
3986,gameofthrones,"There was a pic posted that showed Westeros/Essos basically an upside down U.K./Ireland.

I like using this because then Westeros is about the size and shape as Florida (minus the panhandle)."
3987,gameofthrones,"Needle isn't gonna do Arya much good. She better steal Joffrey's old sword, Jaime won't be doing much with it."
3988,gameofthrones,Wouldn't it be easier just to give Jon some shoelifts? 
3989,gameofthrones,"I completely agree. It's very clear that the humans of that world are very similar to the humans from our own world. That being said, do we have any examples of someone losing weight? I know the books do, but what about in the TV show? While not entirely realistic, I don't mind as much so long as it's consistent."
3990,gameofthrones,Like [this](https://68.media.tumblr.com/5b7f76e7ff7982664fffbb39babbf1e3/tumblr_inline_oegg73WVfY1tu8ofl_500.gif)?
3991,gameofthrones,So I've found the picture I want on my debit card.
3992,gameofthrones,Yes!
3993,gameofthrones,It is known.
3994,gameofthrones,"That's the kind of ghost I would be. ""Hey man I'm not trying to do anything spooky, just wanna watch Thrones!"""
3995,gameofthrones,"I love that I logged on here to see what people thought of fire-proof Dany, Jon and Sansa, even that little shit.. Jon Arryn's kid. 

But nope. I'm reading about how slippery Brienne's lips are because of Tormund's eyebrows. Damn do I love this sub. "
3996,gameofthrones,Thank you a lot 💜
3997,gameofthrones,"No, as in it's not called the great hall in the books, making their use of the term infamous kind of ironic "
3998,gameofthrones,Totally different things and you know it. Don't be that guy. 
3999,gameofthrones,I really hope that Nymeria - Arya reunion will happen in the next seasons. 
4000,gameofthrones,"Worlds apart, hearts broken in two."
4001,gameofthrones,I'd settle for a desktop background 
4002,gameofthrones,HODOR!!
4003,gameofthrones,Can a helicopter attack it back?
4004,gameofthrones,Fight her instead? 
4005,gameofthrones,"the only problem is that she has her claws in jaime, i wonder if she will lose this grip if jaime is going to learn about her affair with lancel?"
4006,gameofthrones,Now all we need is for Ghost and Nymeria to join them and it'll be perfect. Nothing else this series would matter.
4007,gameofthrones,I didn't say MASSIVELY PHOTOSHOPPED. But there's touchup in literally every major area of this photo.
4008,gameofthrones,I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage...
4009,gameofthrones,"I thought Theon and Yara were in Braavos, not Volantis? Wasn't the guy who Arya talked to about booking passage to Westeros Ironborn? "
4010,gameofthrones,Very cool decorations
4011,gameofthrones,You need to share a pic of her doing that smile. It really would complete the look
4012,gameofthrones,"My coworker hot caught going 80 in a 4o with either no license or no registration. Got a ticket, not taken downtown. Arrested for a traffic violation? The fuck outta here. Not in buffalo "
4013,gameofthrones,The entire show ignores peasants 
4014,gameofthrones,Pretty sure Grandma thinks GoT is a Disney movie. 
4015,gameofthrones,"LOL don't worry about it. I just saw the picture again and she is drawn with a bit of a mannish face, yeah. I'm afraid I wasn't looking at her face all that much the first time around."
4016,gameofthrones,"It's possible, there is another continent (Sothoryos?) that has never been fully explored because there's a species of wild, less intelligent dragon-like creatures that keep eating all of the explorers. It's huge though, and no one knows how far south it goes, just like no one knows what's West of Westeros. Honestly, for a land with history stretching back thousands of years, they're a bit lax about exploration."
4017,gameofthrones,Churr bro
4018,gameofthrones,Anyone have a high res shot of Drogon landing?
4019,gameofthrones,"Is Maege even still alive though?
"
4020,gameofthrones,Wow thanks now I know how they are called. Really thank you for spoiling. 
4021,gameofthrones,[YEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5tVbVu9Mkg) 
4022,gameofthrones,WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?!?! oh there they are.
4023,gameofthrones,So sad when the 3rd dragon died and the Tyrion is a Targaryen theory went out the window.
4024,gameofthrones,Title of your sex tape 
4025,gameofthrones,"That's the way the scene cuts, it goes to another shot of him torching the wagons

&#x200B;

Edit: I stand corrected. OP what's the matter with you?"
4026,gameofthrones,That is adorable as fuck.
4027,gameofthrones,"Im proud to say I was part of a guild that finished Cata 50th in the US! We spent a few weeks on spine, and killed madness in like 8 attempts iir"
4028,gameofthrones,"Awesome! Also, great use of backlight. :)"
4029,gameofthrones,"I hope so.. it would totally destroy her character. The guy who forced her to be put into a situation where she was raped, then convinces her to betray her older half sibling? (the only one she thinks she has left). They can fuck right off. Besides the fact that Jon is the most important piece on the board besides Bran and Dany.

Hopefully its misdirection like last season's promos. I can't handle another Jon Snow betrayal scene. I screamed at the TV and cried from that lol. "
4030,gameofthrones,Thank you! There were so many people there I did not see him. He is my favorite on the show because he is a fierce warrior. I call him the wind warrior because he moves so fast and is an expert at using wind advantage. I hope he keeps wining in the war. 
4031,gameofthrones,"Same. I had assumed that the unused pilot was scrapped entirely, but I guess it makes sense that they might be able to re-use scenes that didn't involve Catelyn (originally played by Jennifer Ehle) or Daenerys (played by Tamzin Merchant) or any of the minor roles that were recast. It would be interesting to see the pilot someday. Maybe they will release it with the full series box set."
4032,gameofthrones,It's obviously WINTERgreen. 
4033,gameofthrones,And now his watch is ended.
4034,gameofthrones,Or just used some of the CGI budget on her eyes that's in the movie for all of a few seconds.
4035,gameofthrones,"This image doesn’t make any sense, but it’s very well done. 



Weights wouldn’t be between kings landing and Jaime, their positions would be reversed. 


Also, Drogon wouldn’t be burning the keep, hed be busy burning the more important and prevalent enemy; you know, the weights. 

edit: iphone doesnt like the word ""wight"" apparently."
4036,gameofthrones,Thanks for your support.
4037,gameofthrones,Emilia Clarke as best actor lmao
4038,gameofthrones,I think Bran's still works?
4039,gameofthrones,"Im over here triggered because he said ""the lone wolf die"" "
4040,gameofthrones,Anytime man!
4041,gameofthrones,"The pomegranate is also considered by some to be the true forbidden fruit in the bible.  

Persephone was at heart a good person. If I followed your interpretation, I would say Cersei is Hades, the one who arranged the giving of the pomegranate to trick and keep Persephone in hell.  Jaime has to choose between heaven and hell?  Not sure that fits.  

What do you think?"
4042,gameofthrones,"I mean, small price to pay"
4043,gameofthrones,"my theory is that tyrion is really a targaryan. he, Jon and danerys will ride the dragons"
4044,gameofthrones,Correct me if I am wrong but the theme is the Rains of Castemere right? Reigns of Castemere? Idk
4045,gameofthrones,"Oh, not arguing with your overall point, just correcting the details. In the book, the dog raping was another character, Jeyne Poole. Sansa is still in the Vale and has never met Ramsey. She's never been raped. That's a show thing."
4046,gameofthrones,[this one](https://youtu.be/jnKxlncdZoM) 
4047,gameofthrones,You're welcome 
4048,gameofthrones,all characters are favourites. ALL OF THEM
4049,gameofthrones,"Seriously, who is the person at the bottom?"
4050,gameofthrones,"I feel like Aemon's death is more like a Hodor moment. He wakes up as young and remember this dream and proceeds to become king after all due to the mayhem left by his younger brother in his ""dream"". "
4051,gameofthrones,Maybe I'm misremembering but I think it was Aemon that notes it didn't radiate any heat. Maybe they both did.
4052,gameofthrones,That still holds true I think. Of all the players who play now I doubt a single percent participated in Naxx 40 or AQ opening. Those two raids were very scarce back then. 
4053,gameofthrones,With Edd it's less he wants to die and more fully expects himself to be the one to die.
4054,gameofthrones,"To be fair, at that point he'd had enough of her shit. Doesn't mean he didn't love her, but up until then he'd mostly only had to deal with her threatening *his* life and not the lives of those he cared about.

It's like the difference between your friends teasing you a bit cruelly versus teasing your girlfriend. Amazingly the former isn't the one that will most likely set you off, especially if you're used to it."
4055,gameofthrones,"You know that chaotic neutral and all that shit, why do people act like its a guide to humanity? It never made any sense to me."

4059,gameofthrones,"Don't the Dothraki bring a massive baggage caravan of plunder? I think it might have been easier to pay off most enemies with your overabundance of gold, rather than burn all your precious harvest, again. 

Dany laments this problem in the books, where she is slowly besieged and have vast fortunes, but the former Masters of Mereen burned the crops, since they had no hope of paying or threatening her away. 
Especially farms like olives, which takes years to regrow.

If anything, a collected effort to adapt better weapons, tactics and simply exterminating the savages, would be more efficient. Only problem is that all the city states fights eachother over all things but the slave trade. "
4060,gameofthrones,MIND = BLOWN
4061,gameofthrones,YES.
4062,gameofthrones,I love the Hound and Brienne bonding over Arya.  It seems so right.
4063,gameofthrones,The Ewok from Star Wars?
4064,gameofthrones,It's not far if he flies first class dragonair
4065,gameofthrones,Did they sing Roxanne after though? #TheNorthRemembersCommunity
4066,gameofthrones,"Why did they change the way she says ""dracarys""?"
4067,gameofthrones,"Bronn and The Hound shocked me the most, they both have virtually no significant kills. Quantity over quality. "
4068,gameofthrones,"""Should I have died in vain?""
""If you want to be popular"" 

That has to be the best way to describe a warrior culture I have ever seen."
4069,gameofthrones,This makes me think of John Starks... Which makes me think of his abysmal performance in game 7 of the 1994 NBA finals. No I like Jon Snow
4070,gameofthrones,And now his watch has ended
4071,gameofthrones,"... He totally played this trick with Varys. He told him he was marrying Myrcella to Theon to see if he would tell the queen. If he wasn't testing Varys's allegiance, why would he give Varys false information?"
4072,gameofthrones,And I have the right to call you out for being a dick. That's free speech for you.

4080,gameofthrones,I read that the Lord of Light is based off of Zoroastrianism and I found that really cool.
4081,gameofthrones,"Lena is amazing, in a show with so many great casting choices, from Dinklage, and Dance, to Bean, and Alffie; Lena might be the best imo"
4082,gameofthrones,Book 5 was the first time it took me a year to read a book.  I finally just started reading the start and end of the chapters with Daenerys.  If they ended with anything interesting happening I would reread them.  If I felt I might have missed something I skimmed them.  
4083,gameofthrones,"And now they roast Lannister instead of sheeps, win-win !!!"
4084,gameofthrones,You mean Viserion? 
4085,gameofthrones,Crappy camera work and shitty editing didnt help that fight.

Good comparison."
4102,gameofthrones,"I'm an American who watched with my Finnish girlfriend and in this episode as well when they speak one of the languages made up for GoT there wasn't Finnish subtitles overlapping the English ones...was really nice so we didn't have to toggle them (even though I read Finnish it's still annoying when the white subtitles overlap the yellow). 

Also, I didn't even notice the subtitles went away... I was so captivated by that scene."
4103,gameofthrones,"But isn't Castle Black like.... hundreds of miles away? Which would be tough to do on foot, on a giant ice wall, in a cold-ass winter? With no food?"

4120,gameofthrones,Listen bro. I've seen giants take maybe ten arrows. But seventy arrows? I call bullshit.
4121,gameofthrones,There's also a line in season 5 that seems to indicate Littlefinger may know about Jon's true lineage. He's talking to Sansa in the catacombs and says something mysterious (can't remember exact line)

4125,gameofthrones,I think she did what she did because she wanted the dothraki to fight. If I am not mistaken back in season 1 someone said that the dothraki go around demanding tribute from cities most if not all usually comply but sometimes even if they comply the Khal decide that they will fight them since his men haven't fought in a while. I think that what daenerys did.

4141,gameofthrones,"> So his army, set up to do a battle the next day suddenly takes a holding position? 

Well sure. Jon was attacking Winterfell, not the other way around. You can't suddenly turn your army mobile without supplies and equipment.

> His advance scouts probably reached camp and she rode back to meet him and explain.

Couldn't have sent a scout to Jon?

> If bolton saw suspicious movements he could easily send his own scouts out giving early warning

Sure, but it's not like Sansa was really banking on the surprise attack, at least that we know of. She was the one who told Jon to hold off on the battle."

I imagined him like a Roose Bolton, soft spoken but his words carry weight.  He was quiet but he was plotting.  He sent the sand snakes out across the world to do various tasks.  He sent his son (i think it was his son) to find Daenerys and try to wed her, he sent one sand snake to sit on the small council, another to go support the young Aegon in the Stormlands.  He is ridiculously smart and clever.  In the show he was quiet and they fucking murdered him because they have some bad writers."

4157,gameofthrones,I'm not 100% on any of this but I think by running off to Essos to spy on Dany and eventually serve her he disgraced the house but he left Longclaw with his Father and former lord commander Jeor who then left it to Jon being the closest thing to a son he had left. I believe Jorah is Lyannas brother

4169,gameofthrones,"Would a remotely Democratic system even work in Westeros though? The majority of the population are poor and uneducated and can't read or write properly. The theme of rumour and how lies and misinformation spread has been a huge part of the story. And there are huge economies that the common people rely on, which tbh probably need someone from the established system to do so. Plus, how would elections on a mass scale take place? How would major votes on a large scale take place?

I do think it's interesting the way they show that ""royalty"" is really not an intrinsic thing - through the stories of Gendry, Varys, Littlefinger, Jon Snow etc. who were all born into ""lesser"" status but rose through their own merit. So they may well go in that direction, but I definitely think that what works in Westeros as a governing system would not work well in the real world and I don't know if that's GRRMs intention.

I would like to see the WW defeated, but monarchy kept as a general system, maybe Westeros split back into smaller kingdoms. I"

4174,gameofthrones,"For some reason my favorite part about that scene is that there was no affirmative leap or anything. Just a straight swan dive, letting gravity do all the work "
4175,gameofthrones,Yeah. She was so strong and then shows her vulnerability for the first time in a long time. If you look at her throughout the seasons she used to always show her vulnerability to people and she realised it was a weakness and so she hid it. Now when we see little pockets of her true self its really emotional. 
4176,gameofthrones,"My speculation is that winter is done, but the reason he hasn't published is because it ruins the series.

4177,gameofthrones,"I'm currently rewatching (I only have over the air TV at home, I'm not online at all, so the only internet I need is my phone. Basically, I watch my GoT BluRays a LOT. So even though I'm currently rewatching, I probably rewatch like once a month). I absolutely *despise* Brienne. To start with, just the fact she acts like the most honorable person to ever grace Westeros with her presence... but made the choice to pick Renly. I get most of Westeros not really caring about Stannis's claim because they didnt have proof and the throne was currently occupied and held by the Lannisters. Brienne acts all high and mighty and then chooses a king with literally zero claim to the throne. If Renly made the statement ""I dont care about the laws of succession, I'm going to take the throne by conquest"", fine. Brienne can then acknowledge shes a rebel and not at all as honorable as she shes herself. But no, she pretends that Renly is the king. She had absolutely no business thinking it was her right to kill Stannis. Stannis had every right to kill Renly whether she wants to accept that or not. Preferably not with blood magic, but that's not up to me to decide

And that's just to start with, I could write all day on why I hate her. Shes a hypocrite"
4178,gameofthrones,hillarious! well done OP
4179,gameofthrones,"Really? I actually think the opposite. Daenerys was the pawn in season 7. She had 3 dragons and a huge army and Cersei should have nothing by now yet still won and Daenerys was made out to be someone who can’t do anything without advice despite what she’s accomplished. They made it out that she would be mad if it wasn’t for Jon advising her, who she just met. If anything I think season 7 favoured Cersei and Sansa.
Don’t worry I think season 8 is going to favour the starks but other characters will get the shitty end because of this. "
4180,gameofthrones,Bronn AND Drogon surviving that exchange was really the best-case scenario for the viewers.  I'm still shocked it played out that way.

You can see it from early on. Even when he ran the brothel. He didn't want the girls there. He wanted HIS choice. And when he had all the power, they couldn't refuse. And he'd use them to make sure. His love wasn't love. It was pure ego. "

4306,gameofthrones,">Rapists in real life don't need an excuse to do it, they attack because they want to, and not to show the world they are 'more evil' than previously assumed. Rape not necessary in real life.

Yeah, that's the thing. Although, for rape to be there, the author has to decide to put it there. Although if he wan'ts to be as ""accurate"" as possible to his time period, removing it would be like censoring those old Walt Disney racist cartoons.

Like for example, I was listening to the amazing Hardcore History podcast by Dan Carlin, the episode about the Mongols, and after the 3th episode I just stopped listening to them. Why? Cause the Mongols were too violent. They raped and burned and killed every fucking thing, there are places whose population haven't recovered yet from those atrocities.

I wasn't ""triggered"" or disturbed or anything, it was just too mentally tiring, too much senseless violence that I didn't even felt it emotionally. And it wasn't necessary, it wasn't ""character building"" or any stuff like that, but it was real life. It happened. It just sucked.

And I think that's what that episode was. I just sucked because they don't live in a good world."

This is what bothers me about the lack of ghost, they just don't care. They don't even try to justify or explain it. It's already established that Jon wanted to protect Sansa and if he isn't there to do so it makes perfect sense he would leave Ghost with her. All they had to do was put Ghost laying in the background of a couple scenes with Sansa and put in a throwaway line about him running off for awhile to go hunt as he always has. I can't believe that it would have been too costly to do that."

Does that means Jon McLain was willing to sacrifice innocent lives in order to get what he wants? No, not really. 

Also for Indiana Jones, it's been a while since I watched them (the last one doesn't exist, it was a dream) so I am not sure why you think Indie is an antihero.

4495,gameofthrones,GROWING STRONG !!!
4496,gameofthrones,Or he just castrates them. It was pretty common practice in the 17 century and earlier
4497,gameofthrones,[removed]
4498,gameofthrones,"Holy shit, I always see it from Guts's side, but I definitely can see your point. It doesn't make Griffith any less of a shit, but from his point of view, I can get it. I need to get back into the manga."
4499,gameofthrones,"I was at the comic con panel she talked about in the article. I would not have known she was in any sort of pain. Also, Jason Momoa came out in his Kal Drogo eye makeup which made the whole place go wild. "
4500,gameofthrones,If you were a chick who's the one guy you'd sleep with?
4501,gameofthrones,Why the fuck did this make me tear up
4502,gameofthrones,No. Now it ends. 
4503,gameofthrones,"Closer to Cersei. But Cersei is worse because she’s killed her family members like Tyrion.
She blew up Lancel, so she’s not above killing family if she feels betrayed. That’s not a trait I think Arya would have."
4504,gameofthrones,"Yeah, wtf do I know. Perhaps it's defined my entire existence for the last 14 years and I might have earned some sort of insight into tattooing, but feel free to ignore any advice you hear and ""you do you."""
4505,gameofthrones,"She's like the granny who always says the inappropriate thing that we're all thinking but are too polite to say out loud in front of them. And we feign indignation and disapproval but inside we think, you tell 'em granny."
4506,gameofthrones,What?
4507,gameofthrones,"Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?"
4508,gameofthrones,"I don't know about you but everytime I arrive to a place there's a voice that tells me ""you are now at..."". Google maps totally ruins my reality inmersión. "
4509,gameofthrones,Aren’t the poles supposed to flip sometime in the near future?
4510,gameofthrones,A bit late for that one mate don't you think?
4511,gameofthrones,It was like Aragorn at the Black Gate. 
4512,gameofthrones,"i^2 ?
"
4513,gameofthrones,I'm pretty sure this is talked about briefly in the books. Been a while so I could be wrong.
4514,gameofthrones,"If someone wants to provide a gif of Jon Snow beating the shit out of Ramsay, that'd pretty much make my week. "
4515,gameofthrones,Not so much that you look like him but if you are world famous for playing a sword-wielding warrior who kills frost-zombies and bangs wild women. That kind of gravitas probably works for Kit more than anything. 
4516,gameofthrones,What Targaryen does Varys support in the books?
4517,gameofthrones,"420 blade it

(or 420 raise him...from the dead?)

Both are horrible, ignore."
4518,gameofthrones,"In my childhood years I overindulged with imaginitive playing with action figures.  I would put the toy in my dominant (right) hand and in so doing the figure really only had one way to go which was from right to left. I'm not sure about why others feel the way they do or if it can be explained so simply, but to this day right-to-left is burned in my mind as the ""correct"" direction."
4519,gameofthrones,And we thank you for it.
4520,gameofthrones,"I think she’s to the right of Marcella Baratheon in top right. Am I wrong? 

Edit: I am! That’s Yara"
4521,gameofthrones,Shut up and take my money!
4522,gameofthrones,"jon was also brought back to life via ""magic.""

talk about having something handed to you on a silver platter.  he was literally given his life back after dying."
4523,gameofthrones,Nikolaj for Wolverine when?
4524,gameofthrones,"I totally agree! Im a huge fan of Belgian beers and this blonde was delicious, plus 9%!"
4525,gameofthrones,They definitely did not abandon Varys plot line.
4526,gameofthrones,"I cant decide who is the hottest, Natalie or this cosplayer 🤔"
4527,gameofthrones,Especially since the book is still in the store and someone damaged property that's not even theirs...
4528,gameofthrones,The Rains of Castamere just tops it off especially with the meaning of the song. Still feels like I too was struck with an arrow the way Robb did whenever I watch it.
4529,gameofthrones,It's sad to think that there is only Ghost and Nymeria left.
4530,gameofthrones,Night King = Seto Kaiba confirmed. 
4531,gameofthrones,*poosi
4532,gameofthrones,It's because we live in a Black Hole and are void of knowing about greater places out there.
4533,gameofthrones,Rich but locked away from the world. Also she was betrayed by her own father and mother.
4534,gameofthrones,"I was conflicted: on one hand it was entirely appropriate- no big crowded spectacle or drawn out imprisonment, just the truth and a sentence carried out immediately. OTOH - Theon got epic music for half dead punching a man to death and I wanted at least equal epic music and cinematography for Baelish's death considering he started everything!"
4535,gameofthrones,LEAVE KHALEESI ALONE!!
4536,gameofthrones,Jon Snow low key hoping for that pity sex when he was on that boat
4537,gameofthrones,What victories did she win in season 1?
4538,gameofthrones,[removed]
4539,gameofthrones,tbh she's a pretty lame character
4540,gameofthrones,"can always go to https://images.google.com/ enter the URL of the image and click ""search by image"""
4541,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I think they let a whole 30 seconds elapse between the felling of the dragon and its reanimation on screen.

Season 1 or season 2 thinking would have just departed without ceremony and only the sharp among us would have gone, ""wait... did they just leave a dragon corpse with the Night King?""

And then hype builds for two episodes where the Night King continues to use his human army because zombies don't heal and if you have a dragon zombie you're gonna use it last to preserve its usefulness and because humans are plentiful, then JUST when the Night's Watch are turning the tide after a brutal fight at Eastwatch, the dragon shows up out of nowhere and crushes their weary souls.

They could have made it *good*. They weren't even thinking like a competent D&D DM."
4542,gameofthrones,Your boyfriend needs to put on some weight and this is literally perfect
4543,gameofthrones,"My ancestors were rich land owners, then Communism happened."
4544,gameofthrones,You must be fun at parties.
4545,gameofthrones,"GUYS GUYS GUYS YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE SCENE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE NIGHT KING WENT FOR VISERION. When you watch the scene closely, you can see that Viserion died because the ice spear punctured his throat while he was breathing fire, causing a massive burst of flame to blow out part of his body. The Night King was aware of that, which was why he went for Viserion and not Drogon who was sitting on the ground and not breathing fire. If the Night King threw his spear at Drogon, it would simply have been a minor wound to Drogon, just like Qybern's scorpion was a minor wound to him. In order to effectively kill a dragon, the Night King knew he would have to puncture its throat while it was breathing fire, which would make it explode from within. Look here: http://imgur.com/a/MzX43"
4546,gameofthrones,I see Sophie's eyes but Maisie's face.
4547,gameofthrones,I/me for Halloween is a fragment. If the sentence is what x will be for halloween the it's I. Since I is the subject. It would only be me if the me was the object of a verb or a prepositional phrase 
4548,gameofthrones,I AM MELONLORD!!! MWHAHAHA
4549,gameofthrones,It seems to be like 250 humans tall; how tall did you think it was?
4550,gameofthrones,"The Starks will be probably be extinct the next generation. Girls don't pass on their name, Robb and Rickon are dead, Brann probably won't have kids and Jon Snow is a Targaeryen. "
4551,gameofthrones,I really hope that’s what ends up happening. It would be kind of lame if they happened to defeat the white walkers in their first all out battle. 
4552,gameofthrones,Yea I think he's done a great job of portraying Jon Snow. Maybe it has something to do with him being one of the few among the cast who read the books
4553,gameofthrones,"They'd have good enough indicators from the house banners, but the flames would be an ok second. "
4554,gameofthrones,"Lol oh yah which booth, I’m there every Wednesday!"
4555,gameofthrones,"She'd recruit some lumbering, undead, lethal warrior who doesn't talk and simply does her evil bidding.

Wait a minute..."
4556,gameofthrones,"Lol nah I got a chuckle out of it!


-guy from pic"
4557,gameofthrones,"Bran's came at a price tho, he is weird as fuck now "
4558,gameofthrones,Someone watches Gay of Thrones. I will admit that this season's finale with GRRM made my day.
4559,gameofthrones,No it's the Bud Knight
4560,gameofthrones,"I really hope Petyr has something up his sleeve. As much as it'll probably make me rage to see him fuck over a beloved character again, it just doesn't feel right seeing him backed into a corner like this.

I'm still holding out for a Varys and Littlefinger reunion."
4561,gameofthrones,Nah. 
4562,gameofthrones,Also Tyrion and Jon know each other from their time at the Wall. And Jorah and Lyanna have that Mormont connection. Dany + Jon alliance just makes so much sense. A song of Ice and Fire.
4563,gameofthrones,"This is the problem with the safety that accompanies fame. No irate publisher to please, no bills to pay, writing is no longer his job but something he can choose to do or not to do, a privilege the majority of writers will never experience.  
One he certainly worked for, don't get me wrong, but he essentially talks to fans for a living now."
4564,gameofthrones,Yeah at this rate.. We might have the technology to download GRRM brain and let the fucking AI finishes it for him
4565,gameofthrones,I cant believe you came on my mom
4566,gameofthrones,That knife flip tho.
4567,gameofthrones,Ok? Still doesn't mean everyone has seen it. I'm online pretty frequently and somehow this is the first time I'm seeing it. 
4568,gameofthrones,"Love the dog. That costume on a black lab(?) Tis hilarious, m'lady. Great work."
4569,gameofthrones,Even the Night King [likes to show off.](https://i.redd.it/80osa622aagz.png)
4570,gameofthrones,Dead
4571,gameofthrones,"I didn't know that reference, and I'm 31.

Not everyone is a star wars fanatics that memorize every scene in the movies you know."
4572,gameofthrones,Classic. I still watch this and Coldplay's GoT Musical on a monthly basis.
4573,gameofthrones,"The first one seems the most plausible but even that ones a stretch. My idea is that the night king did it to show Dany what he's capable of. Like a ""come at me bro"" taunt. This war is a game to him."
4574,gameofthrones,"The Hound did unspeakable things too. But that's what I like about the characters. There aren't really purely evil characters with the exceptions of maybe Joffrey, Ramsay and perhaps Cersei. There's more depth to them. Melisandre was evil because she was misguided by her religion, 

Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities."
4575,gameofthrones,Biter licked it.
4576,gameofthrones,why
4577,gameofthrones,Where's jon?
4578,gameofthrones,"""Ned Stark Aunt"""
4579,gameofthrones,"Haha nice, Bronn is my favourite GoT character. "
4580,gameofthrones,Have you tried marshmallow fondant? I make it at the bakery I work at and add almond extract. It's good! And there's buttercream underneath and inside the layers so it's not like that's all you get. 
4581,gameofthrones,"Not so sure those were *really* BWB. Slaughtering an innocent commune because they wouldn't pay up or whatever Tony Soprano style isn't really how the BWB work. It seems like it was STAGED to appear the BWB did it - but by who/why, we don't know. High Sparrow perhaps? Someone want's Sandor back in the thick of things."
4582,gameofthrones,It looks smaller
4583,gameofthrones,Before I even clicked for the full size image I knew there had to be Tommen killing Tommen. Lol
4584,gameofthrones,Could the end of it all be a normalisation of the seasons?
4585,gameofthrones,"No, it was burn the mall"
4586,gameofthrones,Wow I didn’t even realize he was the same guy. It’s just been so long since I’ve seen him in GoT
4587,gameofthrones,"I wonder if [ADWD](#b ""we will see the scenes with Sam in Citadel, particularly as to the obsidian candle."")"
4588,gameofthrones,Name checks out.
4589,gameofthrones,"Well, that's the most awesome thing I've ever heard. Tipping my head for Mr. Martin on this."
4590,gameofthrones,He certainly did a leap of *faith*
4591,gameofthrones,"If he dies, so does my HBO subscription.  "
4592,gameofthrones,I think the marriage option is inevitable. Especially with fewer and fewer allies.
4593,gameofthrones,Not always
4594,gameofthrones,"It's a modernized Vanitas. It's a still life representation using certain motifs. If I'm not wrong, there are 5 characters and 5 objects (including the dog) so I think the creators are slipping in some vital information while being witty as fuck. "
4595,gameofthrones,[removed]
4596,gameofthrones,Global Cooling is just a hoax created by the Iron Bank to harm Westerosi businesses.

4600,gameofthrones,Are you telling me Jon is gay now? There was a lot of hugging going on between Thoros and Beric.
4601,gameofthrones,TIL that this picture was reposted but maybe you haven't seen also heres my butt hole gonewild
4602,gameofthrones,They call him Rolly-polly Olly because his head never stops.
4603,gameofthrones,"A foil isn't a real kind of sword and neither is an epee. They are analogues for actual historical weapons used in modern fencing. The foil is supposed to be similar to a rapier and the epee is similar to a small sword. As it happens, though foils and epees are very flexible rapiers and especially small swords are relatively rigid so that they can pierce thick clothing or light armor. The claymore is a very long thin sheet of steel and is incredibly flexible, and using it well has much to do with compensating for that with technique. A broad sword would likely be the least flexible of the examples that you gave, do to the relatively short length and the wider blade. That being said some flex is neccessary in all blades; if they do not flex, the break."
4604,gameofthrones,"Definitely. After hooking up with Gendry, watching him die, and watching Jon die too. "
4605,gameofthrones,Depending on how dark the finale is I think it'd be great for closing credits of the series 
4606,gameofthrones,"No, I - as a person, was team Jon and will be team Jon. To the end. I'm not happy about his bending a knee. "
4607,gameofthrones,Show passed the books. Clever plots are a thing of the books. 
4608,gameofthrones,"I really hate the argument that if something has sci-fi or fantasy elements, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief for *everything*. I can buy fire-breathing dragons and sorceresses birthing smoke monsters, or warp drive and replicators if the setting gives internally consistent reasons for such things existing. Hell, Star Trek can string together a random sequence of sciencey words to explain why their main sensor array can suddenly do whatever the plot requires of it and I'll just sit there going ""neat!"". But mundane shit, like an obese man not losing any weight after spending years at what is essentially a penal colony, or that a touch-screen console can explode, killing it's operator, but will still work when another crewman takes over their post (to say nothing why there aren't *surge protectors* for those things) is nonsense I can't buy.

4609,gameofthrones,Ah so cool!
4610,gameofthrones,"Lions = Lannister, so...."
4611,gameofthrones,"“You bald cunt” 
God I love how much of a dick The Hound is "
4612,gameofthrones,That was my thought too but this fits so much better and is a good reference to the book material
4613,gameofthrones,Oh man... yikes.
4614,gameofthrones,"Yep - I heard that as well.  I found a link which I posted further down.

4618,gameofthrones,"Jaimie hasn't really been given a chance to show remorse for Bran. Not saying he will but Jaimie's redemption arc started when he was prisoner of Robb Stark. Having been treated so poorly and yet better than what how knows a Lannister army would've treated him sent him second guessing his stance on things. 

Maybe if he and Bran cross paths, he'll show some remorse for his actions. I'd imagine he'd frame it in a way that he realizes he was a major part of what led to the destruction and constant warring Westeros has faced the last few years."
4619,gameofthrones,"Or Ramsey would have gotten him, personally I'd take the sword to the head. "
4620,gameofthrones,"This was Emilia's best season, Kit's was season 6 imo."
4621,gameofthrones,"Thank you, I really appreciate it. I have an Instagram page which my wife and I frequently post to with our latest projects, we are always making something and often post progress shots to show the process.

Kids these days are too soft"
4635,gameofthrones,Finland is awesome. They way you guys fought Russia in WWII is the stuff of legend. 
4636,gameofthrones,I would play the fuck out of that game.
4637,gameofthrones,I want some magic to regenerate his hand so he can be a badass fighter that made him feared in the first place.

4646,gameofthrones,What story is that?!
4647,gameofthrones,That's because the percentage of people living in cities in medieval times would be way lower than nowadays. Way more people were needed to produce food back when most of that was done by hand.

4649,gameofthrones,You could be hot too if you stepped into large fires once in a while
4650,gameofthrones,It's his fault for not using enough Pthalo Blue.
4651,gameofthrones,"She nailed what I consider to be he hardest part of acting, the moment her and Jon make eye contact, she played that she needs to cry but she doesn't want to. It really worked given that I was the first time she saw the guy she loves that she just sacrificed a dragon for wake up and not be dead, and it's the first time they see each other since Viseron dies. It was an incredible moment, and she fucking nailed it."
4652,gameofthrones,Tommen by far
4653,gameofthrones,"I don't know, it might just be a red herring. These fan theories are getting more and more outrageous. "
4654,gameofthrones,Everyone deserves comfort and to be happy. Owning a company that produces incredible medical equipment earns you quite a bit more than that. I don’t understand why that’s so wrong? Without these prosthetics the people in need would still be in need.

4658,gameofthrones,"Muito foda, parabens!!!! plano de sair por alguma editora por aqui??!"
4659,gameofthrones,"The problem is that lowering the temperature of a whisky can remove the naturally occurring fatty acids, esters, and proteins and that changes the flavor and aroma profiles of a whiskey.  Many single malt companies go to great lengths to avoid chill-filtration, and cooling it can pretty much undo that.   

It's not about ""hurr durr, drink it like a man.  don't water it down you pussy"", it's more about negatively altering such an expensive product.  But I do agree it's the individual's money and they can do whatever they want to their purchase - the best whisky is the one you enjoy however you enjoy it.  That's better than people who just collect and never open the damn bottle.

However, none of this really applies to a chill-filtered blend like Johnnie Walker, as they've already removed all of those natural acids and esters and watered it down for quality control/consistency purposes since it's such mass marketed / mass produced item. 

Basically if it says ""non-chill filtered"" best not to chill it.  But ultimately you should do whatever you enjoy. "

4677,gameofthrones,Such a perfect answer.
4678,gameofthrones,"I think it's speaking to the general instability of the realm.

Two years ago, either Robert or Joffrey were King, Robb was fighting for independence, Hoster held the Riverlands, Lysa ran the Vale, Balon had the islands, Tywin with the Westerlands, Doran had Dorne, Sansa was on her way to becoming Queen, dragons were extinct, and Daenerys was terrified of the Dothraki.

Who the hell knows where ANYONE will be two years from today."

4681,gameofthrones,"They waited until his blood reached the top of the  screen to fade out, to symbolize his death and soul reaching heavenwards just like the falling handkerchief in Braveheart.  That's not good"
4682,gameofthrones,Dude?

4684,gameofthrones,It ends with some kid watching danerys and john snow bang in a tower and john snow pushes him out
4685,gameofthrones,"I would try to convince my dad to watch it subtitled! My dad has no clue of English but he still watches everything with subtitles. It must be really odd to watch this show (with all the accents and nuance) in Spanish, are the dub actors good?"

4690,gameofthrones,"The Daynes aren't even in the show (and no, name-checking Arthur Dayne doesn't count), and the rest of the world isn't developed much in the show. Also, Lysene people commonly have silver hair/purple eyes. Also, the spoiler character isn't in the show, so it's not important. So for the purposes of the show, it's completely irrelevant besides making Dany even more ~special and unique~ than she already is."
4691,gameofthrones,Agreed. 
4692,gameofthrones,OMG I love it! That's killer work! Great job!
4693,gameofthrones,Sometimes.
4694,gameofthrones,We all live in very different directions so I guess it was just easier to go home. Plus some of them are talkers and would have ruined the episode for sure. You don't mess with GoT.
4695,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I never said it wasn’t a fact. I was responding to a comment that said GoT was barely related to the war of the roses. "
4696,gameofthrones,"Yeah, that really bugged me. I guess we just have to accept that Showtah's tactical prowess is somewhat diluted. "

4706,gameofthrones,"The show did cut some corners, but it's not like the books have been *that* consistent about details travel distances. And to me it's somewhat forgivable on TV since they have way more logistical constraints to deal with. "

4709,gameofthrones,"She is not a knight, yet..."
4710,gameofthrones,"I think that a child of Jon and Dany (adopted or legitimate) is likely to be on the throne. The story loosely follows the wars of the roses, and that ended with the creation of a new dynasty out of the merging of competing houses."
4711,gameofthrones,"ok it took me forever to realize you typed Dwyane and Dwayne and that they're spelled differently... which i'm guessing is what happened when his grandma mixed it up, naming him"
4712,gameofthrones,Floors could be heated.
4713,gameofthrones,I just noticed the resemblance between Jon Snow + Ghost and [Artorias the Abysswalker + Sif from Dark souls](https://youtu.be/Ag60ZF-IdKk). Both Knight-like heroes fighting evil forces with mythical wolves as companions 
4714,gameofthrones,Ewan is literally the right age... Why would you use anyone else.
4715,gameofthrones,"I think he reads his own press too much, this is deeply engaging genre fiction, but he isn't the great American novelist or the next Tolkien, and trying to always subvert expectations where the skeleton of the story is just a classic fantasy story is arrogant and impossible."
4716,gameofthrones,Bravo!   
4717,gameofthrones,"i don't think it was based on that at all dude, BotB was a straight brawl between relatively tiny forces with separate ""waves"" of troops. cannae was entirely different"

4732,gameofthrones,Of Bebbanburg in about 2 more seasons you mean =p
4733,gameofthrones,"It's not that we didn't SEE the traveling. It's that armies literally just popped up convienently all over Westeros. There's also the whole Dany flying to the wall travel, and Varys traveling instantly in, I think, season 6. Now even if we don't consider it fast traveling, remember how important a role scouts played early on. Rob lies to a scout that was captured and leads a secret attack on Jaime. Later on in the show we see entire armies moving wherever they please and no one knows (Lannisters walk all the way to highgarden unnoticed, Dothraki move all the way to Lannisters unnoticed, Greyjoy fleet moves all the way to Casterly Rock unnoticed). It just destroys my sense of suspense tbh. "

4738,gameofthrones,Now I just need the HD screengrab breakdown of the entire trailer so I can obsess and theorize over it for several weeks!
4739,gameofthrones,"Great explanation, thats all I was asking. I wasnt implying the ""its just magic"" excuse or anything but rather just asking for someones insight on why they can accept all the super natural aspects of the show instantly but not things like a dragons appetite being satisfied behind the scenes somehow. I dont care about the dragons need for food unless its an integral part of a plotline like Cersei trying to starve out the dragons if she cant beat them, for example. Since i didnt care, i just wanted to know why other people do and how they rationalize the whole subject. Unfortunately i got a lot of people thinking i was just saying its all just magic if you cant explain it. "

Some girl i follow on IG does these really cool window gem hangers which includes welding thin pieces of metal and glass to look like gems (they go on the corner of windows and its like a decoration thing) its no bigger than a sheet of paper and the smallest goes for a little under $700 dollars. As long as you make anything that's relevant to today's hipsters, you can totally milk them. "
4743,gameofthrones,"Ya know, we thought about it and I'm just too damn big to be jon snow. Plus with my skin color, it would of looked awkward "
4744,gameofthrones,She looks more like the Disco Queen than the Mother of Dragons.
4745,gameofthrones,"It didn't need to be tied off. I'd argue they didn't anyhow.... We still don't understand shit about Benjen, and why he of all people (I guess because of Stark), he gets to live this half dead half living sort of undead life.

I got questions, and I was comfortable with them never being answered.... But whatever."
4746,gameofthrones,"That's, like, the price of a house in Toronto..."
4747,gameofthrones,I thought that the reason she opened up a hole in the middle of the Lannister line was so that the Dothtaki could penetrate it and run everyone down while the dragon was taking down the supply lines. 
4748,gameofthrones,4 more months! 4!
4749,gameofthrones,"I'm never sure if that description from the books means that he legit looks 10-20 years younger than he is, or if he just aged extremely well but still has grey hairs and stuff xD I wanted to take a younger picture of the actor either way (it's more fun), but he's extremely hard to find."

4759,gameofthrones,How did you get your Sansa Stark tag?
4760,gameofthrones,I bet Dany will at some point have to choose between using her dragons to either win the Iron Throne or defeat the Night King. It'll end with Dany's vision coming true: the Iron Throne covered in ice and snow.

4766,gameofthrones,Alt universe where GOT is a light hearted comedy. 
4767,gameofthrones,"But polygamous marriages are not officially recognized in Westeros. They're forbidden by the Faith and that prohibition has been accepted by the ruling class since the time of Aegon I's son Maegor. Jon was conceived when Elia was still alive and married to Rhaegar. Since a king is the only person who can nullify his own marriage and a counsel of Septons is needed to nullify any other marriage, but only in the case of non-consummation, which we know was not the case with Rhaegar and Elia, according to long held laws and traditions Jon is still a bastard."
4768,gameofthrones,"Bastards in westeros are named based on where they are born, not where the parents are from. Since ned refused to disclose any details about Jon, and he ended up being raised at Winterfell anyway, he became Jon snow."
4769,gameofthrones,"Man, they have brakes too?!?! shit, these high tech swords are awesome"
4770,gameofthrones,I mean she was compliant in killing king Joffrey but she hot so whatev.
4771,gameofthrones,"I thought at one point that they might bring stoneheart into the last season of the show, but then I realize they probably wont because there is no point to bring her into the show."
4772,gameofthrones,"Cersei doesn't give the sands up for anyone. This would drive a wedge between them. If dany is the idealist ruler she pretends to be she shouldn't kill Jaime as he did what he did to protect KL.


Edit: should to shouldn't."
4773,gameofthrones,"That's like political bs happening in any country of the world while climate change is destroying all life on the planet, completely impossible to imagine... oh wait"

4805,gameofthrones,Holy shit - I was wondering why he wouldn't be there. They showed him with Jaime at Kings Landing and the pit and then brought cersei out for everything else at a different day or shot.
4806,gameofthrones,"this, the only surprise will be who survives. As we know theyre going to win"
4807,gameofthrones,It bothers be how they never explained in the show why their swords light up.
4808,gameofthrones,I see what you did there
4809,gameofthrones,"What are these?  I googled them and found the YouTube page, but I'm at work and can't watch one.  Are they like commentary on the episode or something? "
4810,gameofthrones,"This is barely cosplay, her hair colour is cerseis colour and the only thing similar to daenaries is her eye colour?"
4811,gameofthrones,To be fair the books barely had any Stoneheart in them.  So the show would have to make up a lot of the material for her.
4812,gameofthrones,Is Tormund dead? 
4813,gameofthrones,"When Sansa asked where she got the faces, Arya said ""in Braavos while I was training to be a faceless man."" I think I saw Walder's face in the bag, but maybe some of them are from Braavos or belong to relatively obscure people who are unlikely to be recognized. (Like the serving girl that killed Walder)

As for simplifying thing for the viewers, they could've done that by showing Arya transforming into someone else. I kind of want to see how that works actually."
4814,gameofthrones,"Actors act better when their face isn't covered, but there is also the rule of cool/sexy. Why would you waste the free fanservice that is Kit Harington's face just existing by covering it up with a helmet? Why give protective clothing or armor to Daenerys so that she actually looks like a badass dragon master when you can have people drooling over her figure that is accentuated when she wears light silk dresses?"
4815,gameofthrones,How many times have you said that. 
4816,gameofthrones,What did we do to deserve Davos? :3
4817,gameofthrones,Why do all the amputees get all the cool stuff :(
4818,gameofthrones,"When he said ""my beloved wife"" in that scene I was so rattled. Ik the video of him being a nice guy is 100% a joke but I also think it shows how good he was at making Ramsay's reckless nature shine through. Even when brutally murdering people or viciously taunting them like he did to Santa, he got this weird joy out of it."
4819,gameofthrones,"Davos had a chapter where he smuggled Melisandre beneath Storm's End so that she could give birth to the shadow baby that would go on to kill Ser Cortnay after the chapter ended. We do see Storm's End in the books, but not the full castle in the show"

4822,gameofthrones,No touch? But SO PRETTY!
4823,gameofthrones,I never quite understood that. Did she say that because of superstition that she broke her promise to the gods to love Jon? How would things actually have played out differently if she had loved him?

4829,gameofthrones,"Well, when the current Queen Cersei acquired it by right of conquest, even weak claims like bastards could gain enough traction for a rebellion if they are charismatic enough.

That's why Robert was so keen to try and kill all the Targaryens.  Since his claim to to the throne was by conquest, any somewhat legitimate claim could pose a real threat to his reign."

4839,gameofthrones,He never had to share a room with his siblings?
4840,gameofthrones,It’s funny you mention that. I just watched the episode where the other kinda-warg could summon flame on his hands. What’s that about?

4852,gameofthrones,"don't even get me started on that show. it lost me when they were living in the prison. Like, come on guys. You have piles of zombies at the fences and you wait til there's hundreds before you start killing them with sharp sticks? They could've used fire, ran them over, or instead of standing around in groups reminiscing about the days of yore, they could've just taken an excavator and made a mote. Also, they don't use scouts or body armor like they did in earlier episodes, not to mention the lack of basic hand-to-hand weapons, like bats or swords. They don't even need metal armor, just thick denim would prevent a bite, but instead they run around in tank tops. Ugh, so frustrating... "
4853,gameofthrones,I always wonder how they filmed that. Like how do you get a 7 year old actor to suck a fake tiddy without emotionally damaging him 😂

4862,gameofthrones,"Since Jon is named after a father figure to Ned who wasn't actually related to him, and his other sons are named after people who are related to him, it stands to reason (based solely off of this naming theme) that if Arya is a play on the last name Arryn, and is therefore named after Jon Arryn, that she isn't actually his daughter.

She is his daughter, of course. The guy was making a joke."

4865,gameofthrones,"It's possible the child chose the costume even though she probably hasn't seen the show. Maybe her parents tell her appropriately fantastical bedtime stories about the characters, or something. 

It's also possible the parent chose the costume, but even then the explanation could be that the kid was like ""IDK, what do you think, mommy?"" Youngins do that just about as often as they vehemently insist on their own ideas. 

I don't like when parents force their kids into costumes they don't understand, but I also don't like when people judge others' choices without any info at all. We don't know anything for sure other than that this kid makes a damn cute and broody Jon Snow. "

5072,gameofthrones,My two fave shows coming together
5073,gameofthrones,Did Lady Martell die? Cersei kissed her daughter with the poison on her lips to make sure that Lady Martell go through the same thing as Cersei (to watch her daughter die). I can't remember she died. Did I miss something? 
5074,gameofthrones,"My take is that the show had mentioned Cersei having a child with Robert who died almost immediately, so in the show Wood Witch prophecy, ""having children"" meant having children that would survive infancy. Also, unless Myrcella wore a crown as the betrothed of Trystane in-show, they elected to use only the pun on ""crown"" -- they were all golden haired, when the child of Robert's that died was dark.

Still, the show is throwing around fertility/infertility references like crazy (and I have my own tinfoil hat theory about the Night's Watch vow originating from a prophesy about Jon). 

There's lots of ways to end up pregnant or impregnating someone without it actually resulting in a child living to even Tommen's age.  Few are good.

I definitely don't think Cersei has told Jaime that her prophesied three children who would live have already died, though.  Whether she thinks she defeated the ""curse"" somehow or is just using this to manipulate Jaime further... it's working. "

5090,gameofthrones,I think the theory is that was supposed to be adult Bran. He was seeing a future version of himself. Some time in the future he travels back and gets captured and turned into the Night King. Not sure I buy it but who knows. Guess we'll find out in a couple of months. 
5091,gameofthrones,"Imagine the one person in the world you love more than any other.  Now imagine that this one person AND yourself are in a position where you absolutely will BOTH die if this kid you barely know at all survives and speaks of something he saw you doing.  

Now imagine you're presented with a scenario in which a plausible ""accident"" is right there in your face to explain the boy's death.

I'm going to be honest, while there are lots of people that wouldn't go through with it, if you weigh the life of the person you love above all others (and your own) versus the life of a stranger, if you say you wouldn't even consider killing the stranger AT ALL  to preserve your own life and that of your beloved, I think you're probably a liar.

5110,gameofthrones,"That theory is bunk, Bran already knows that ""the ink is dry"". That was the whole point of The Door and the 3ER's final lesson.

It wouldn't shock me if there's a bit of temporal shit linking Bran and the NK, but there's no way Bran wargs into that guy's body to reason with the CoTF. Maybe he'd do something similar to find the NK's weakness or some such, with disastrous results, but that theory specifically is a solid 0%.

The closest he'd do is, and I think this is absurd and would be lame, is become the Night King so that he (Night Bran) can kill himself. He'd like, become the NK and do all that evil stuff killing millions of people, and in the present day have something remind him that he's Bran then he'd kill himself. Any Bran = NK is kinda stupid though."

5123,gameofthrones,"That's actually not that unrealistic (even though in the show the arrows are shown as not quite reaching the top iirc.).


Turkish medival compound bows had a range of well over 2000 ft, with the modern record for a compound bow beeing 3560 ft.

The best medival bows could reach speeds way over 350ft/s, meaning that you could even shoot a guy standing on a 1700ft wall."

5131,gameofthrones,"He was never a proper character though, not part of any plots, or had any development. In the show he got a few lines, in the book he was just a brat that threw tantrums, and that was it He was always going to be nothing more than a hostage or arrow fodder."

5142,gameofthrones,Kinda like the Tom's shoe donation that looks like you're helping but actually takes away from there local shoe economy
5143,gameofthrones,"I'm not arguing with you that it's easy to just keep the Eyrie at bay with 50 men at the bloody gate, that's 100% true. I'm just saying it's basically impossible for the Eyrie to change hand through a siege. From the definition of siege I posted, from just holding the gate you will never make them surrender, they can sit up there all they like and there's really nothing you can do. Also Caitlyn climbing the Eyrie... that's like a random 50 year old lady trying to climb Mount Everest. That's not comparable to expert climbers, the Eyrie may have some that have been climbing the mountain their whole life - It's not unreasonable to think that.

""The way Alexander took Tyre was by conscripting lots of Ship’s to destroy the city’s navy, control the surrounding lands and committed a full on assault by both land and sea on a depleted population (the city residents shipped out most of their peeps before Alexander realized he needed boats)."" A full Lannister army with Tywin commanding it will easily be able to do this and within a year (took Alexander 7months to take Tyre), Tywin will be pissing from the Riverrun ramparts into the Red Fork. The same army will never be able to take the reach, and Tywin can sit there sulking about never being able to make people fly from the moon door. 

You raise a good point about no value of the Eyrie. I completely agree it's a useless castle and only good for defence but for that purpose, it does it the best out of all castles. If you have many enemies and want to go somewhere to live without fear, the Eyrie is your place really. 

Also I hate the Eyrie too, fuck heights, low oxygen levels etc. Riverrun is by far my favourite castle, looks amazing, love the huge ass moat but that doesn't mean it's hardest to siege imho"

The catapult used by Astapor against Dany would have to be a bit more unique than it looked for it to actually work, it looked like a Mangonel. Also having fire on a wooden ship is extremely dangerous and stupid, maybe when you're on calm seas but during a battle you're sure to burn your own ship. Point being the Technology to fire fireballs from a ship is not as easy as just a catapult (which is a very broad term)"

5246,gameofthrones,"That was just symbolism! Y'all need to learn when the writer is using prose and when things need to be taken literally. When Dany says that Viserys is not a dragon she means he never had what it takes to be a leader.

You were the OG offended person in this comment string. 

“Who said I even cared? Don’t get so defensive mate”. This comment reeks of condescending bullshit that one would say when they are being defensive. 

Perhaps my use of the pot calling the kettle black analogy is going wooooosh right over your head.

Perhaps the “you act like your shit don’t stink” saying might be more to your taste? 

Do you think your inability to secede to this simple point may indicate that YOU are the one seeking to be offended? "

5364,gameofthrones,"I was literally in the hospital, a day or two from having my own insides cut up in a lifesaving procedure, I missed the Red Wedding.  I knew some major character were killed, but I didn't actually see the episode until weeks later when I'd been home a couple of days and I felt like I could focus long enough to follow the story.  I remember, still dealing with severe heart failure, taking an inventory of my reasons to live.  Seeing this show play out was one of those reasons.  Yet when I thought, ""I need to make it at least five more years to see the end of Game of Thrones,"" I was imagining five more seasons as well."

5371,gameofthrones,There's a difference between being slowly burned at the stake like Mance was and being incinerated by dragon fire like Randyl and Dickon were. Death by the latter is only slightly slower than a beheading.

5380,gameofthrones,"But then again Tyrion was the one who mocked the Nights Watch more than once.

Jon: The Nights Watch protects the realm.

Tyrion: Ah yes. From grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You are a smart boy, you don't believe that nonsense."
5381,gameofthrones,Would Jorah accept or would he only want the home run?
5382,gameofthrones,That's excellent. I'll add my voice to the chorus of remarks on the iconic Targaryen eyes.
5383,gameofthrones,"Eh, what can I say--I'm not above hamfisted attempts at upvotes."
5384,gameofthrones,Well a lot of the battles in the earlier seasons were done of screen because they didn't have th budget at the time. Robb didn't win with allies showing up with calvery.

5397,gameofthrones,"Season 1 just feels so real. Like it could happen. The later seasons really lose that, but then perhaps it's unavoidable with how the plot develops. "
5398,gameofthrones,"Not to mention they are physically more intimidating than the characters cast.  They were varied in size and the whip one (I don't even care what her name is) is rather large and has a physical presence.  I simply don't find them at all interesting , complex, or what GRRM intended. "
5399,gameofthrones,"Probably because in the books he doesn't marry for love. He's wounded in a battle and while being taken care of receives news of his ""brothers"" death and Theons betrayal. Ends up sleeping with the lords daughter during his grief who was taking care of him  and then marries her because its the honorable thing to do. Also the lords daughter was being pushed to seduce him by her mother who was currying favor with the Lannisters."

5533,gameofthrones,He's just SO good. 
5534,gameofthrones,"Cersi would think about double crossing them and Croaker would already have a plan for it. Probably One Eye planting some kind of explosive under her bed.

Black Company was such a good series."
5535,gameofthrones,The fire in a freezing world.

5538,gameofthrones,So who's making this into a 3840x1080 dual screen wallpaper with a few more pixels?
5539,gameofthrones,#Come with me and *take this city!*
5540,gameofthrones,"Not just that, Theon is severely damaged. You don't just get over all that in a few weeks. He's been molded into what he is and it's his rare stints of bravery like saving Sansa juxtaposed to his PTSD induced ""cowardice"" that make him a great and complex character."
5541,gameofthrones,Littlefingers death was pretty satisfying for me.
5542,gameofthrones,great Asian stunt guys
5543,gameofthrones,Sounds like Warhammer fantasy. Oh the fans want more story do they? Well then how about we just destroy everything. 
5544,gameofthrones,I don't think my grandma would be a very big fan of the show because nudity's not really her thing and she's dead.
5545,gameofthrones,different kind of daddy

5548,gameofthrones,"That doesn't mean it's not still his brother. Everyone still know's he's ""The Mountain""."
5549,gameofthrones,Right? God bless America would that be awesome. 
5550,gameofthrones,"My favorite part of that scene was he notices the snowflake, and theres already patches of snow next to his horse."
5551,gameofthrones,"There appear to be no rules against using guns.

I'd bring a gun to 'it'. A big one.

Edit: removed select words"
5552,gameofthrones,I guess with the exception of Long Claw you’re right 
5553,gameofthrones,"Tyrion, Onion Knight, Varys, and then Arya looking at a effing dragon. "

They will tell you that she has been known to bring aurochs down all by herself, that no trap nor snare can hold her, that she fears neither steel nor fire, slays any wolf that tries to mount her, and devours no other flesh but man.”"

5557,gameofthrones,I opened this in the mobile app and it just crashed it 
5558,gameofthrones,but they didn't even like lighten his hair and gave him a full on dark beard?  It was so jarring for me when they transitioned it seemed like the first dude walked off set and they literally had to grab someone and use him before they lost the light and just stuck with it.

5562,gameofthrones,"This is why I don't like Daenerys that much. She's sooo arrogant. The names, the threats, the entitlement. She's never even fought before. Jon always puts himself on the battlefield to fight for his people and what he believes in. He's almost died to Wildlings, White Walkers, and Boltons, and actually did die to the traitors at the Night's Watch.

I'm waiting for Daenerys to try to tell him how things are and him to mention ""Have ya ever been in a battle yer grace? Not at one, IN one. With a sword in yer hand and a line of cavalry charging at ya. The dead bodies of yer brothers at your feet.."" etc."
5563,gameofthrones,"I mean, you could, but it seems unnecessary.  Just go visit."
5564,gameofthrones,"Might be getting a tour of the set in the Titanic Quarters soon, can't wait."
5565,gameofthrones,"Would generally refer to being trained according to:

5577,gameofthrones,It's like they got Casterley Rock and Highgarden mixed up on the show.
5578,gameofthrones,"I saw that, really cool. I think that type of weapon is called a [caestus](http://weapons3.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/a-forbes-detailed-views-of-a-roman-cestus-a-leather-glove-used-in-ancient-boxing.jpg)"
5579,gameofthrones,"They really have an actor for the Night King? Must be easy money for him, since he is CGI most of the time except for that one scene?"
5580,gameofthrones,"does transfer of knowledge count as a bribe?

If you were a politician and I were to tell you to sell your stocks in xyz company if you give my company abc in return, would it be bribery and insider trading or just insider trading?"
5581,gameofthrones,"Whatever man, I'm glad you could enjoy it. I wish I could have. I've been waiting for Dany to ride north for over a decade, and I thought they blew it. "
5582,gameofthrones,On an open field? Terrifying.
5583,gameofthrones,"This leads to a side show of Tormund's rebellion against the Lannisters just like Robert against Targaryens

5585,gameofthrones,"It feels more organic that way, reality is messy and rarely contained. However, there is a 99% chance it will feel incomplete to me at the end as a result. GRRM cannot possibly tie up everything. Depends on your preference I guess."
5586,gameofthrones,This is beautiful

5593,gameofthrones,"Don’t remember where I heard it, but there’s a quote that goes something like “There’s no true despair without hope”. Ramsay gave Jon (and the viewers) hope for Rickon by letting him run to Jon. His death was worse because of that glimmer of hope. "
5594,gameofthrones,"Yes, GRRM has admitted that he kinda screwed up with the ages.  All of the children act much older than they officially are, even if you consider the whole ""children would grow up much faster in a violent medieval world"" thing.  Similarly, see completely unrealistic heights and weights of characters (especially the mountain)"
5595,gameofthrones,[deleted]
5596,gameofthrones,First episode she doesn't become burned from the hot water drawn for her. 
5597,gameofthrones,i didn’t say he based his whole class on GOT.. he sent it to us as a fun joke
5598,gameofthrones,"It could be that the hypothetical offspring of Jon and Dany would be the ""song of ice and fire"" - a child that shouldn't exist and yet does, the child that bridges the gap between two worlds (this is all assuming that both Jon and Dany survive until the end, so you never know)."
5599,gameofthrones,"A large ammount of them are, the entire city of Mereen, Yunkai, Astapor and Qarth are 100% CGI as are Harrenhal, Dreadfort, Horn Hill, Castle Stokesworth, Winterfell, Dragonstone, the Red Keep etc."
5600,gameofthrones,hahaha now i wish i could give YOU gold just for that!!! 
5601,gameofthrones,"Ygritte?

5607,gameofthrones,Wasn't intending to come across as a complainer. My apologies
5608,gameofthrones,"I think she probably just has some overly 'chivalrous' ideas of what 'fighting' is.

If you've got people fighting to the death it ain't gonna be chivalrous. Shouting you fight is just a childs way of shouting 'you cheated no fair!' when they rigged the game."
5609,gameofthrones,That's Jaime fookin' Lannister 😮
5610,gameofthrones,"Jesus, have we really gone thus far? "
5611,gameofthrones,"theon greyjoy, now you're truly lost"
5612,gameofthrones,"Don't know why you get downvoted. It's absolutely true. Almost everything you see is enhanced with cgi. Yes, dragons take more time to make. But that doesn't mean that all the budget goes to it. "
5613,gameofthrones,Ending of season 8: Westeros foreclosed and residents evicted.
5614,gameofthrones,There is only one Brandon. While traveling forward in time he is Bran. While traveling back in time he is anti-Bran. But the threads always connect through space-time. 
5615,gameofthrones,You don't drink... until you do.
5616,gameofthrones,Quick kill it while it's distracted! 
5617,gameofthrones,Such a good episode... such a good season... such a good show.... so cannot wait for the last season... I wonder what the spin off will be about? 
5618,gameofthrones,"depends on whether you're an individual or a small group in a hurry, or a royal procession with wagons and massive feasts at every house you pass by."
5619,gameofthrones,It's one of my top 5. Excellent series. 
5620,gameofthrones,"A lot of people on Reddit seem to think you can't enjoy something and be critical of it at the same time. That is, if you criticize it you must absolutely hate it."
5621,gameofthrones,So glad she's going to be in season 8.
5622,gameofthrones,"> Dany went from ""I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms"" to ""I hope I deserve it."" Shows how far her character developed this season.

She's been doing since the beginning. She understands that she needs to be strong and assertive as a leader or no one will accept her or take her seriously...but when she has trust and support she has always been humble... I have no idea why people think she's entitled. She's literally worked to earn what was her birthright. Her entire journey to Westeros has been trying to build something and prove she deserves to rule. 

She's only stern and says I was born to rule with people that she feels are getting in her way. Her whole arc has been trying to fight injustice and trying to be a deserving leader. "

5641,gameofthrones,"Probably the bartender just goes ""get that sweet ass out of here"""
5642,gameofthrones,"Just have to say Kit Harrington really sold it in this episode. His eyes in so many scenes just sell the desperation, determination, and the out and out hollow ""I've seen some shit"" look that increases the emotional intensity of his performance ten fold. Bravo. "

When we saw Reek without a shirt on in an earlier season his whole body looked like someone tried to put out a forest fire with a fuckin rake"
5668,gameofthrones,"There is a theory running around that the dragon is a white walker, and thus immune or resistant to fire like what we see before the ice spearing scene. "

5683,gameofthrones,[deleted]
5684,gameofthrones,That would make sense with her whole speech about shooting arrows prior to her more aggressive confrontation with Sansa.
5685,gameofthrones,"So let's not talk about how horrible rape is, through a fantasy show that intends to show us how horrible humans can be. In the end I think is better that people see that rape is disgusting and traumatic, isn't that kind of the point? I mean, if people can't handle a fantasy show how could they handle real life with real rape and murder?"
5686,gameofthrones,She just got beat up.
5687,gameofthrones,At first I thought it was just a cutout of a printed photo. This is amazingly well done. 
5688,gameofthrones,"Damn!!! Did you make this or buy it? If the latter, how much (if you don't mind me asking)"
5689,gameofthrones,"I wanted more, to see her lay out his entire plan, with her having figured out that he intended to have Sansa take the North from Jon, then use the combined northern armies to march south and take the throne from Cersei.  

But, it was still good.

Plus, I LOVED that Sansa figured it out on her own.  Bran didn't lay it out, Arya didn't explain it to her.  SHE figured it out on her own.  "
5690,gameofthrones,"The saint that was promised will bring the ale.

5691,gameofthrones,I liked the old Dario so much more for some reason 
5692,gameofthrones,Looks like the smoke monster from Lost. 
5693,gameofthrones,I agree. We don't know anything for certain until they tell us.
5694,gameofthrones,"Are there two scenes of where Jon snow gets ghost as a pup? I could have sworn Ive heard two pieces of different dialogue from this scene, one was what we have now, and another was similar to the books.

Current dialogue:

Theon: The runt of the litter! That ones yours Snow""
 
Book, and what I thought was show dialogue:

Jon snow - I think not Greyjoy, this one is mine"""
5695,gameofthrones,Ugh she's so damned cute. 
5696,gameofthrones,i gotta bang what to get you an army?
5697,gameofthrones,"Not Lena (Cersei).  She's pretty vivacious and energetic, not at all like the miserable bitter bitch she plays on the show."

5699,gameofthrones,That’s the coolest stained glass I’ve seen.
5700,gameofthrones,Calling this cosplay doesn't do it justice. this is amazing.
5701,gameofthrones,"But he doesn't need to have any sexual desires, Cersei could just ask him to rape her on top of torturing her, that's something she would do imo"
5702,gameofthrones,It also seems weird to me that they did that much work but still left so many scenes unedited.
5703,gameofthrones,Wow

5705,gameofthrones,***WINE***
5706,gameofthrones,"Cersai is an idiot, a vicious moron. The only reason she succeeds is because she takes the most ruthless tactic available. It's was Olenna that hinted at it with her last conversation with Jamie. "

5721,gameofthrones,"I thought about this. What if Dany trades Jamie for all the gold at King's Landing. If Cersei can't pay her debts, she will lose faster. She will have to choose between her lover/brother or paying the Iron Bank."
5722,gameofthrones,"My son is a dead ringer for Bran and I know a girl who looks exactly like Sansa. I need to find some way to get you all together.

Unfortunately my son doesn't even watch the show and resists all my efforts to get him to exploit his resemblance. I mean, I suppose it's not as fun as looking like Jon Snow, but some people would get a kick out of it."
5723,gameofthrones,It is known *nods*
5724,gameofthrones,"So, they're like the Reapers? Unless this time is special, and they have the ability to permanently destroy them."

5732,gameofthrones,Thank you! 
5733,gameofthrones,It was the equivalent of Neville Longbottoming.
5734,gameofthrones,I would call her a main Antaganist although Im pretty thats show only. I think Bran and Arya are definitley going to be important in the next season although when I said sansa I was more thinking of the books as her story os setting her up to become the new lady of the vale in the books rather than what she is in the show.
5735,gameofthrones,"Can someone please explain the feather instead of hating on OP?

And every throw I had to go up there and get my one javelin and walk back and throw it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. Could've been the 20th throw, or the 50th, I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye.”

Arya loses her sight and gets the shit beaten out of her, comes back better than ever.

Sansa gets raped, destroys her rapist.

Bran evaporates for a season after losing his friend.  Comes back almost a 3ER.

Dany has been born from fire twice now.

Jon has literally died.

5780,gameofthrones,"They're coming back, I don't disagree with that, I just think the opinion on them was misguided from the beginning. "
5781,gameofthrones,"Loved this scene.  What makes it my favourite is that Jon and Sansa weren’t even close before this moment.  In the books, Sansa doesn’t even acknowledge him as a brother, she always refers to him as her ‘half-brother’.
But when they meet, they realise that they are the only family they both have left (to their knowledge)."
5782,gameofthrones,Soo much happiness does not seem probable in this shows lol but maybe it's b/c I've become such a pessimist
5783,gameofthrones,Don't buy into hype. Assume each episode will be normal length until 100% confirmed otherwise. Much less disappointment in entertainment that way.
5784,gameofthrones,"Cersei didn’t either, she only has it because Tommen committed suicide and she was there.   

Jon was elected King in the North, so he does have claim on that (I’m very dubious on if he truly gave it away, he didn’t really look at her during that scene, nor did we get an scene where he physically carries it.   So much telling going on, not much showing).

Do remember that Robert actually had a blood claim to the IT, so it wasn’t just conquest he gained the throne, it was a blood claim, for he too, was the great grandson of Aegon V.   In the books, Varys is using the Targaryen name to gain the IT, it still holds some weight.   

Though on grounds of the Targaryen claim, Jon has the bigger claim, he would be the rightful heir and Westeros would be more accepting of him.  Personally, he would be the better ruler, especially with the right council at his side.   "
5785,gameofthrones,Gendry! He's Robert's only living son.

5807,gameofthrones,"Start reading the Accursed Kings series. It's a series of historical novels set in 14th century France & England about the downfall of the House of Capets, the rise of the House of Valois, and the eventual Hundred Year War between the Capets and the House of Plantagenants. GRRM even said this series helped inspire him to write ASOIAF and even said, ""The Starks and the Lannisters have nothing on the Capets and Plantagenets"".

I'm currently almost finished with the first book about to order the next one and I think it's really good. You should give it a shot!"

5813,gameofthrones,"I kind of blame Brandon Stark for the war, slightly more than Aerys.  He hears that his sister has been ""abducted"" by Prince Rhaegar, and without finding out the whole story, takes off to King's Landing and starts yelling for Rhaegar to ""Come out and die""  

I'm pretty sure threatening your King's heir with death counts as treason.  If he'd gone there asking to speak with Rhaegar or Aerys and request redress or an explanation, he probably wouldn't have ended up strangling while his father burned to death.

Edit:  Yes, a lot of other shit went wrong, and a few different people are to blame.  I was just pointing out that screaming death threats about the Heir Apparent to his father, the current King, probably led directly to Brandon’s death."
5814,gameofthrones,not to soon for tommen! he loves a good laugh. 
5815,gameofthrones,"The New Gods Saga is a pretty self-contained story (albeit unfinished), but they appear in many other DC story arcs.

So yes, you can read only the Kirby works and you'll understand. But their story reaches even further. There are still ongoing titles featuring them (in fact, miniseries Mister Miracle by Tom King is the best comic series this year by far)."
5816,gameofthrones,"Her mother was Jeor's sister, so that would make her Jorah's first cousin."

5862,gameofthrones,"Hmmm. This has me thinking of an end game scenario. We've known for awhile now that King's Landing is essentially mined with a ridiculous amount of Dragonfire. If a significant portion of the Army of the Dead attacks there the city could be sacrificed and deal the NK a major blow. I personally doubt it'll play out like that, but there has to be a good reason that Dragonfire stockpile has been stuck under the city for this long, narratively."

5869,gameofthrones,"Oh noo. I'll cry for days if it happens..  But she's kind of *too good* for Westeros.

5871,gameofthrones,Bo-bo-bo-no
5872,gameofthrones,"I think what he means by that is there are a whole lot of people who thought the Dorne stuff was just okay. Not great, not as shitty as some people claim, but just okay. Not about to shit all over it or anything.

Then they come here and 99% of the people just shit all over the Dorne scenes. My opinion was that I didn't feel strongly one way or the other, but now that I've come here and noticed just how many people are shitting on it, it'd be smart of me to shit on it too instead of trying to fight the shitnami by defending the couple good points about Dorne.

Hell, even insinuating that some people shit on Dorne ""just because"" can get you a ton of replies about just how shitty it was. I'd rather have had lackluster Dorne included than still be saying ""What the fuck, is DORNE gonna be in this show?!"""

Yea, yea, here comes a bunch of people to disagree...

But even by the third novel, there wasn't a lot of talk about them except how they were too much about politics. Very UN-Fantasy novelish. 

I have seen all the TV episodes. And it still surprises me that I liked the novels and shows. Usually the show/movie falls short of the book it's based on. 

But as I like to say, there's a reason the show is called Game Of Thrones and not A Song of Ice and Fire. "

5998,gameofthrones,"There were definitely some storytelling faults. The Sansa/Arya storyline was pretty weak (they've really never known what to do with Arya), and it takes a few logical leaps to convince me that they would go find a wight for Cercei. I do understand why they wouldn't send Dany on a dragon though:

\- Dany doesn't totally believe that they exist yet, so why would she risk leaving Dragonstone while she's losing a war  at the request of a King she doesn't recognize.

\- Even if she did go, they are trying to get ONE wight to bring back. They probably know that the wights will be with the army of the dead, so they have to be sneaky and tactical to get one without the whole army on their tail (mission: not accomplished) AKA, if they want to be covert, a dragon is not the way to do that...

I DO agree that it feels like we've been shortchanged on the Direwolves. I understand all the issues, but I feel like the bond between Stark and Direwolf reveals a lot about their character. I just hope we get one good fight with Ghost next season. That being said, if we only get Ghost in the ""sitting and talking"" scenes because they want to give us dragons in combat, that's A-Ok with me."

When Jaime rides out of Kings Landing to deliver king Tommens justice in the Riverlands, we see a whole new internal dialogue from the Kingslayer. It's hard to deny that he's sincerely trying to be a new man. He even goes so far as to muse to himself after hanging some outlaws, ""Make a habit of it Lannister, and some day men may call you Goldenhand the Just."" There's also how well he treats his squire, Pecc. He even let's the kid fuck Pia in his own bed.

Some are legit titles for her position, like Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea or Queen of the Andals and First Men (made as a claimant), while I think others like The Unburnt, Breaker of Chains, or Mother of Dragons, were given to her by her followers and supporters. If Jon wants more titles (which he certainly deserves), then the Freefolk, Night's Watch, or the North have to give them to him.

> So by not playing the title game, Davos effectively robbed the effect her titles had, even if he didn't mean to.

Book Jon had the forethought to store two dead men in the ice cells beneath the wall, anticipating that they may rise and he can use them at some point for something. If, in the books, if they go with the ""show Cersei solid evidence"" plan, they'll probably use those dead guys.

Keep in mind at this point D & D only know the basics of where the plot is supposed to go from GRRM. They knew who lives who dies who sits the throne and the major events that transpire. Martin hasn't plotted this far ahead yet, D&D are having to do it for him in a very short amount of time, which is why the story hasn't been quite as detailed and bendy as before.

6151,gameofthrones,"Yeah I'm not saying it's 10/10 TV, just that initial reactions are from people who sat at home on the couch all Sunday rocking back and forth looking a blank TV all day until they start refreshing their Apple TV every 20 seconds until the new episode is available on HBO Now. I would assume these are the types that overreact....OMG BEST EVER 22/10 STARS, WTF IMDB WHY CANT I RATE IT HIGHER, IT WAS SOOOO GOOD."

6158,gameofthrones,Dolorus Edd is like actually one of my favorite characters.
6159,gameofthrones,David Bradley is a sweetheart however. I met him last weekend. Such a lovely guy. Not anything like the sort of characters he usually portrays.

6164,gameofthrones,Blackfish loss still hurts.  Such hype.  Such let down.  Frey mocking him was just salt in the wound.

6167,gameofthrones,Couldn’t get into Reznek mo Reznek? 
6168,gameofthrones,"Dragons themselves are not an indication of magic, as there were dragons in Westeros up to a hundred years ago. Dany being able to wake them from stone with fire and the blood of a king is definitely a sign of magic returning, but with everything happening around the world, with small magic being possible and growing stronger as winter approaches, I think that the Others bring winter and magic with them."
6169,gameofthrones,Ramsay came out to meet them. They couldn't hold off. That's why Stannis was forced to fight as well even though his plan was to wait.
6170,gameofthrones,We saw his eyes in the last episode. Most fucked up thing would be if he had Joffrey’s head considering how fucked up his eyes were. Imagine Jaime’s reaction if that was revealed after Cleaganbowl
6171,gameofthrones,Beautifully done. And a stunning look.

6173,gameofthrones,So salty.
6174,gameofthrones,The kite in the North!

6184,gameofthrones,"I felt really bad for Jamie after his meeting with Blackfish last season. He really looked up to him in his youth, and to be labelled as a disappointment by your hero must be devastating.

Also Walder Frey, a man everyone dislikes saying he and Jamie are alike. I think the events in riverun did a lot for Jamie to realise that Cersei isn't worth it all."
6185,gameofthrones,They say that Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the high king. SHOUTED him apart.
6186,gameofthrones,Littlefinger: *shits pants*

Many thanks!"
6193,gameofthrones,"What? 50 cm is only like 20”. It can snow that much overnight in the mountains. Growing up in a ski town in a house with a normal sloped roof made out of aluminum, we were still up there shoveling once a week. By mid winter we could walk on the snow straight onto the roof without a ladder. 

I can’t imagine not having a sloped roof in the mountains. You’d literally be up on your roof shoveling it off every afternoon. Hell, we were out shoveling our deck every other day."
6194,gameofthrones,Olyver. The one who slept with Loras and but was a spy for Petyr.

6201,gameofthrones,She did the same thing during the Battle of Blackwater. She nervous.
6202,gameofthrones,"It's like Mac from IASIF cosplaying John Snow. 
And I approve. "
6203,gameofthrones,"Yeah the way I see it, that wasn't a GRRM 'anyone can die (twice)' thing, so much as it was just expert direction and production. How do I put this, a person being waterboarded may know he's not actually drowning, but that doesn't stop his brain from telling him otherwise. "
6204,gameofthrones,"Is jon really 5'6""? Im not a book reader sorry "
6205,gameofthrones,Bran 😅
6206,gameofthrones,No they weren't. Aegon and Maegor were polygamists. It's like saying that all Lannisters fuck their siblings.
6207,gameofthrones,holy damn the detail! Amazing!!!
6208,gameofthrones,"He explains it pretty well. He thought that Ramsay would be a bastard so thankful for a well born wife, that he would be easy to control. Sansa would only need to work her magic for a few weeks, and Winterfell/the North would be hers once Stannis won. She would marr him, and they would have freaky sex.

Unfortunately, shit didn't end up that way. Ramsay was the Vista version of Joffrey, and Stannis lost.

Edit:  Fixed the wolf reference "
6212,gameofthrones,"I'm iffy on this ending well for Littlefinger as well. She HAS to hear rumors from other Lords after the battle that LF was behind the death of her father and near destruction of her family - other Houses are going to be vying for a marriage with Sansa as well so they will try to beat out the competition as much they can.

In the end it all depends on Sansa and I hope the writers have smartened her up like most of us are expecting."
6213,gameofthrones,Potato tomato
6214,gameofthrones,Except it's an ear off one and a tooth from the other...
6215,gameofthrones,That was my first guess as well. Or some weird Boba Fett cross over where Arya gets a jetpack and blaster then just destroys Westeros.
6216,gameofthrones,[deleted]
6217,gameofthrones,I was there as well. Didn’t meet him but went to the panel. This was my first year. Is it always such a shit show?
6218,gameofthrones,"the frame adds literally nothing to the joke, I'm not sure how it'd build up the punchline..? "
6219,gameofthrones,This is all great...but what is LittleFinger planning to do about Dany's dragons? 
6220,gameofthrones,I was always under the impression guest rite is reciprocal. Hosts can't harm guests and guests can't harm hosts.
6221,gameofthrones,200 years.
6222,gameofthrones,Burn.  Them.  All.
6223,gameofthrones,Except that Cerci still has no idea how to do the right thing. I think that bran is the night king. And is going to kill her because she found a way to beat Danny. That's why he didn't try to kill the dragon Danny was on. But he needed some assurance that he'd be able to kill that slimey Lannister bitch.
6224,gameofthrones,The LOTR of the small screen!
6225,gameofthrones,"Hell, you could name him King Beyond the Wall at this point and no one would fuss."
6226,gameofthrones,"I'm not going to jump on the hatewagon but GoT is much more a fantasy world than one focused on politics and intrigue in recent seasons. I think that's why he's less relatable, as he's far more focused on moving the story along by doing what's right than acting in his own character's (and by extension our) interests. He joined the nights watch for a sense of belonging, not duty, for example. I think Jon as an actual character has taken a backseat to Jon's role as a *main* character."
6227,gameofthrones,"It's from ""the science of the discworld"" if that's your question."
6228,gameofthrones,"You are fucking terrible at math.  Nothing you wrote makes any sense. You say it makes 1 billion dollars, that might be now but it didnt when it first started. You are just assuming it made 1 billion for all of their seasons. Which is wrong. You are also taking their revenue and expecting that to also be their profit. Which is also wrong. Just stop."
6229,gameofthrones,You're going to die for some chickens?

Oh sure

Whoa whoa whoa, slow your roll there.  HBO aint made of money!"
6231,gameofthrones,I knew there had to be a sub for this abomination somewhere
6232,gameofthrones,"House Mormont brings shields for their enemies to use, just so they have a chance. "
6233,gameofthrones,"IMO I disagree. Sansa doesn't trust him but she knows she needs him. Notice how Sansa is more confident and comfortable confiding in Littlefinger and not Brienne? LF planted a seed in her. They think alike now. That whole bit with Arya talking about how Sansa likes nice things may be an implication of that. She thinks materialistically and in ambitious perspective of gains and loss. But they (Arya and Sansa) aren't working together at least not yet. Right now, Sansa trusts Littlefinger MORE than any of her siblings. Think about it, she withheld info from Jon Snow which might correlate she doesn't fully trust people even her own siblings her perhaps she shares the idea that a bastard son can try to kill and overthrow the primary offspring of a House. Bran is basically a drooling drone. Arya is some facewearing creepy lurker. Sansa trusts Littlefinger only. Brienne to her is really nothing more than a tool. I mean she respects and cherishes Brienne but her role is limited beyond being a guard or obeying her commands. How can you confide in a tool you use (although IMO I think Brienne can give pretty sound advice to the girls).

IMO I think Bran might be their best chance to get the sisters back together. Bran's the only one who can find out Littlefinger betrayed Ned Stark and he can do it as easily as touching the Valyrian dagger. I'm not sure HOW he will be convinced to give up such info because he's not even human anymore."
6234,gameofthrones,"Didn't say petite maiden fair.  Could be giant maiden fair.  Definitely doesn't need a man to guard her maidenhood, if she deems it needs guarding.  By that I mean she's not a blushing maiden in need of protection, but a badass, butt kicking maiden who intimidates all but the most secure of men.  By that I mean me.  She intimidates me."
6235,gameofthrones,"That immediately came to mind for me. Can't forget that guy screaming ""Momma"" as he lay dying"
6236,gameofthrones,"Ireland is correct, wiki: Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom"

6255,gameofthrones,Are you supposed to wear chain mail under full plate?
6256,gameofthrones,"Dany's not really the good guy either. She has proven time and time again that she is terrible at ruling and she would rather have her people follow her blindly than their heart. 

This especially became apparent when she made Varys swear, that he would not act for the good of the ""people"" but instead follow her no matter what. "
6257,gameofthrones,All this character build up just for Random Archer #34 to finish the series for us right then and there. 
6258,gameofthrones,Cause we just bumped uglies. The last season is taking forever. 
6259,gameofthrones,"Amazing work. The legendary set should include: a faceless pokemon (ditto-esque), a child of the forest(dark), a three-eyed raven (psychic)... and of course a Hodor pokemon, who only knows 1 move... Hodor."

6272,gameofthrones,"It is possible just very difficult, especially using wood."
6273,gameofthrones,"Didn't anyone see? He ran far enough down the length of the wall that he avoided the section that collapsed. He's one of like, two survivors (the other being Beric).

In Season 8, Episode 1, he and Beric are probably going to arrive at Castle Black via the parapet at the top of the rest of the wall and tell the Night's Watch and Edd what just happened. Might even be the very first scene."

6287,gameofthrones,"I can see it now.

Jon leads all the remaining forces of humanity into the far North in a surprise strike at the heart of the White Walkers. There's a magical weapon frozen deep beneath the earth that can kill all the White Walkers. Jon leads a desperate charge at the entrance to the cave leading to it. And then the Night King swoops across the field, burning half the forces running, and narrowly missing Jon. Jon is knocked back, and falls unconscious for a bit. 

When he wakes, he stagers forward through a couple wights,  including a pesky one with a crossbow and a shield at the entrance to the cave. Inside, he reunites with Benjen Stark, who somehow escaped the army of the dead when he rescued Jon. But the reunion is short-lived. Cersei appears, ravaged by crazy experiments, claiming Qyburn altered her mind, and that she can control the White Walkers. She uses her power to force Jon and Benjen to halt before they can kill her. After a long monologue, she forces Jon to attack Benjen. Then Jon breaks free, and kills her. 

Jon and Benjen are both too tired and wounded to go on. Jon stays with Benjen while he dies. Then, out of nowhere, a ghost of Ollie appears. It tells Jon he was deceived, there was never a weapon that could destroy the White Walkers. The White Walkers have existed for millions of years, rising up to curb the corruption of humanity before it could destroy itself. But Jon having found the cave is proof that the cycle can't continue. 

Jon has three options. If he destroys the red ice column to the right, all White Walkers will die, and all magical beings with them. This includes people brought back to life by fire magic. If he slides himself into the blue pond to the left, he'll die, but he'll become the new Night King, and control the White Walkers. His last option is to burn himself in the center of the room, on a mystical platform. Doing so will spread a little bit of ice magic into everybody, removing the need to fight. 

Jon contemplates the decision for a full minute, brooding. Then he tells Ghost Kid he's wrong, there are four options. And he carves up Ghost Kid. Inexplicably, everybody dies because of this. And so ends A Song of Ice and Fire (ME edition)."

I think John's body size fits the character and makes Sam's accomplishment more meaningful. If Rambo trekked across the Arctic then stabbed a zombie to protect some girl he's trying to bang...that would be mundane. If an overweight and downtrodden boy that no one believes does it then it's so much more powerful."

6349,gameofthrones,Wasn't Bran watching with ravens when the NK attacked? He should already be warning the others to prepare the dragon glass (hopefully).
6350,gameofthrones,"In the show, yes. The books more heavily imply the Mountain died and Qyburn performed shady bloodmagic to make a construct of some kind out of the Mountain."
6351,gameofthrones,"John Gruden commentary: ""That right there was a football play man! the Night King just throws the ball so hard! Yaknow, I was talking to him before the game, and he just likes to sling it man! and with an arm like that, I don't blame him. You just can't teach football like that. I tell you what. I wish I had a guy with an arm like that down in Tampa. We would have won a few more superbowls if you know what I mean. Man I love this guy, and I love this game."" * nods head. "

Other contests pick em the Sparrows have certainly pissed off a lot of people in the oligarchy houses big and small would be chomping at the bit to supply a champion to teach the little man he can't win. 

I think the real question here is who would stand for the faith. Lancel is the all to obvious number one seed. But other more prominent small houses might use this to a springboard to greatness but that's just me. I mean look what Dunk managed to pull off by winning.    "

6429,gameofthrones,"> It just feels so sloppily written now.

Aside from the single continuity issue of Sansa not knowing about the dogs not being fed, I feel like it's not ""sloppily written"" and we're just acclimated to the writing in general. Not everything has to be a surprise. It's not like the writers kept The Vale army secret in any way. I have a suspicion we'll find out what the true cost of calling in The Vale was next week. Probably Sansa marrying Littlefinger

I'm not disagreeing with some of your points, but most are glib. Some points are articulated well, but they still have a negative tone to them that this episode does not deserve."
6430,gameofthrones,"My thoughts: 

The wight that doesn't die wasn't raised by that Walker, he just happened to be traveling with them. 

The NK needs Jon/Dany alive right now so they can play their parts south of the wall. He got the one dragon he needed to destroy the wall. 

I think the director weighed in on that but I honestly can't remember 
Bonus question: is Viserion a wight or a Walker? He was touched by the WW, which didn't happen to other wights, but he wasn't alive when it happened, unlike other WWs. "
6431,gameofthrones,"Yep, it also showed the desperation Jon had to save his brother.

Sansa already accepted Rickon's fate, Jon was not having any of that.
This shows how Sansa may actually be a superior leader to Jon. (they kinda ruined this with the bullshit from last season, I guess they made up for it when they offed Baelish)"

6440,gameofthrones,"The illustrations in that book are all over the place though. I know it's the ""official"" approved version of how things are, but a couple of the castles look way more fantasy-like than they feel in the books.

6445,gameofthrones,"Wolves generally *won't* hunt you, actually, they tend to do everything in their power to avoid humans, unless they've somehow been taught to be comfortable around them. Sure, if you're trudging through the forest at night, alone, tired, and stumble on a hungry wolf pack, then you might be in trouble, but just about any animal is prone to be aggressive in that scenario. But most of the time, an encounter between a human and a wolf ends with the wolf backing off. The bigger problem is that they tend to go after farm animals and livestock, which makes then very unpopular in most communities that rely on farming."
6446,gameofthrones,"Yep, every time they showed the cast I never saw a single redshirt yet anytime there was a death it was suddenly some redshirt character who apparently was just offscreen the entire events previously but with the main cast. Such a shame. 

Also hard for me to understand how an episode can have such a high budget and world-level talent making it yet make such an easy to rectify glaring mistake. All they had to do was show the redshirts a few times before their deaths instead of suddenly having them in infinite supply during the action scenes."
6447,gameofthrones,"Anybody else keep expecting Missandei, Grey Worm, and Tyrion to get poisoned in that scene? There was too much focus on the bottle and on the glasses as they were drinking. "

The Hound was damn near dead after Brienne put the hurt on him and Arya left him there.  It was safe to assume that he was going to die.  So this is almost like bringing him back from the dead, only to kill him (if they do it next episode)."

6493,gameofthrones,"I enjoyed in a way how Littlefinger's demise this season inversely paralleled Ned's demise in season 1.

Ned headed south and is out of place in a city of liars and schemers. Renly runs out of the city, Slynt is bought and Joffery is chaotic (& stupid) enough to top him. Ned doesn't see it coming. An honourable man dies in a dishonourable place.

Littlefinger tries to manipulate every living Stark this season in Winterfell. His schemes aren't working here as the North is a different place where oaths mean something. Bran see through him and Arya is suspicious of him. Eventually he is found out, he scrambles to defend himself but his previous tricks and lies all come home to roost. Littlefinger doesn't see it coming. A dishonourable man dies in a honourable place."
6494,gameofthrones,Exactly! Spoiler!
6495,gameofthrones,"It should be, even GRRM has said he made the westeros far too big, and the wall too big.

  

To copy paste myself from a comment I made a month ago on this subject:    
\-----   
Westeros is supposed to be the side of the US+Canada (north of the wall), and Essos Africa-Ish sized.

Which is just insane the number of cities and distances between them is just idiotically sparse for that, it would mean each of the great houses rules lands equivalent to several european countries in size. 

Frankly I think GRRM just wanted the scale to be impressive sounding (a common thing in fantasy authors to make their worlds stupidly big) but didn't really think through the realities of a world that big at that technology level.   
Travelling from Winterfell to King's Landing would require ~2 months (think walking from New York city to Dallas Texas) - in the books it says King Robert did it in a month - which is shite - that'd be 50 miles a day.

large groups on foot averaged 20 miles per day at best, large mounted groups maybe 30, and small mounted groups 40 (messengers for example). 50 was possible for small groups with regular mount changes over the journey. You could do 100 with a fresh mount every day riding hard every day.

Roberts travels were slow and would have stopped at every nobles of note along the way [for at least a night or 2 - it would be a grave insult to do otherwise]. It should have taken him the better part of 2-4 months."

6532,gameofthrones,"Even as a book reader I'm going to miss these recaps almost as much as the show. Just wanted to say u guys do an awesome job, keep up the good work!"

6568,gameofthrones,Who else had the song immediately start playing in their head?
6569,gameofthrones,"See, I definitely think that's going to come up, since there are so few full armies left in the Seven Kingdoms; I wouldn't be shocked if it plays a role in the expected Cersei downfall. Dany/Cersei ceasefire followed by Dorne siege of KL for the return of Ellaria."
6570,gameofthrones,"Hair, eyebrows, makeup (it helps she looks like the actress playing the character), the eyes done like they are in the book. It absolutely all counts as cosplay. If she walks into a room and people recognize who she's supposed to be, is that not successful cosplay? People on here are so weird about the things the choose to point out or complain about. "
6571,gameofthrones,"I know most people here ship Jon and Dany really hard but I think it's a terrible idea, and I figured that look on Tyrion's face was just him agreeing with me. Jon is making the same mistake that Robb Stark made by throwing it all away for a girl. There is a major conflict between her desire to rule and the interests of the people who follow him, which was hinted at in the scene with Sansa and Littlefinger."
6572,gameofthrones,I was wondering if Dany would burn Cersei but damn!
6573,gameofthrones,Believe me it's worse when people hear you laughing inside a toilet.

Hmmm..... would they be so attentive to detail that Arya is killing people in that eye color order?  "
6578,gameofthrones,"Shows how believable the character is though from previous seasons, I had no idea what was him being genuine or not in that scenario.

Brilliant character and the only way they could tie up his plot in my opinion.


I was shitting myself incase Jaime died though, I thought there was no way they could have 2 lannisters say ""kill me"" to Cersei in the same episode and neither die.

The ultimate fake-out."

6587,gameofthrones,"I was rooting for that guy. He was my favorite. 

Though actually, I thought they missed a GoT ""fucks with tropes"" opportunity to kill several more important characters but have one of the wildling sledshirts ride Drogon to safety and then never be seen again. "

6608,gameofthrones,"I wouldn't say it was a weak episode, it's a build-up episode. The climactic episodes wouldn't happen successfully without episodes like these building up to them and leading the way. We need something to pave the way to them, and I think they did a good job at making it still interesting despite that. The battle at the end was certainly worth all of it."
6609,gameofthrones,"Yes, them sparring by the river with Joffrey and Sansa coming through the woods watching. That would make a great addition to this. "

Is it Jaime since a lot of people view him as a monster for slaying his king and having 1 hand? Or could it be Ser Gregor, a literal monster, in a Frankenstein-esque story where the monster turns on the master?

A lot you could do with this. Personally I find the Cersei storyline the best in the show."

Man, this subreddit is one of my favorites. This community is so fun and helpful for the most part. And up until recently the keeping spoilers under wraps was phenomenally well done!

Thanks for trying for me. :)
I didn't like the actress much myself due to the reasons you and a few other commenters mentioned! But I also had a strong aversion to her character from the start and the stiff acting wasn't ENTIRELY to blame.  At least I never thought so! She just seemed to be using and manipulating Tyrion and like she never loved him as a person, only him as a Lannister. Almost like she was always thinking ""I deserve money, gifts, and THE BEST treatment from him OBVIOUSLY because I fuck him on the regular. And for The Gods' Sakes ! Look at him!"" Ontop of all of that, she was incredibly dumb while believing she was super smart, cunning, and better than most other women. Because she was ""well-traveled"" in more than one way."
6668,gameofthrones,This was also when there was supposed to be a 5 year time skip.
6669,gameofthrones,"TIL I'm a reddit bot.

6671,gameofthrones,"I assumed the more braids were from her victories, but I never bothered to count them. It's one the reasons I love daenerys so much though. As much as she's changed through the series, she's always kept her dothraki braids. She's still the khaleesi."

On the for real though. Most theories be like GRRM is the high septonstein einstein of GOT. But in reality he is just an average at best writer, making bank on the gold which is GOT!

6761,gameofthrones,"Going to call this right now - if you look at [Viserion's eyes](https://i.imgur.com/O7FO6fb.jpg), the way they're depicted is much more in line with the white walker eyes (reference the [WW baby](https://i.imgur.com/MbGp95z.jpg)) than the foggy blue wight eyes.  Also, the resurrection was accomplished with a touch, not from a distance as he did at Hardhome - again, like Craster's kid.  The dragon, either by the NK's choice or because dragons are special snowflakes, is the same sort of thing the WW's are and not merely a wight.  

Not sure what this *means*, but it's at least an indication in favor of ice breath given the WW's power to summon cold.  "
6762,gameofthrones,The Czar is such a bad ass song!!  along with the rest of the album
6763,gameofthrones,Right. I imagine Ned Stark sitting around mumbling fuck my honour

6767,gameofthrones,"Damn, Planet Earth is one of my favourite series. I still havent gotten around to watching Season/Series 2 but Im going to tonight.

6770,gameofthrones,Lookin good!
6771,gameofthrones,"Ever notice the evolution of Sansa's hair? Ends up looking real similar if not identical to Cersei's (until Cersei's gets cut obviously). In 7 we get Ayra telling Sansa how it sounds like Sansa looked up to Cersei. Despite the conflict between Sansa and Cersei, and Tyrion and Tywin, i don't think that Sansa or Tyrion would deny there is apart of their foe that lives in them, or that they are not inspired in some way by them.

Complicated relationships; really interesting show. "
6772,gameofthrones,"A single solitary piano meticulously cutting through the beginning of that scene, with patience and insidiousness... just perfect.

6792,gameofthrones,Jorah's greyscale. Maybe it wasn't fully healed as Sam thought it might have been?
6793,gameofthrones,"ABSOLUTELY. I do not understand the bitching and moaning in this thread. THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR LENA AND DINKLAGE. By submitting two of their five main actors in a Lead category, they are giving better odds to their two heaviest hitters in Supporting. Although, this could also free up submissions for the other supporting players who have previously been squeezed out, like Glen, Gillen, or NCW. 

When Thrones started, the cast was huge and sprawling and no one ever had enough screentime for Lead before (other than Bean in S1). We're down to a tight-knit group now so the Leads are a little more defined and drawn. Its obvious in the last season that this whole freaking story comes down to Dany and Jon. Supporting is going to be an embarrassment of riches, however, when we get to Emmy picks for next year. Dinklage has two Emmys already, so I really really want Headey to get the recognition she so richly deserves before the show is done. 

To be frank, Emilia doesn't stand a chance for a nom when that category is so STACKED. If Gyllenhaal doesn't win for The Deuce, something is seriously fucked up."

Except for having to dig through 6.5 seasons for 10 scenes tops"
6797,gameofthrones,"I wonder whether Jon is standing in front of Ned’s tomb, contemplating the man who believed was his father or if he’s looking at Lyanna’s tomb and thinking how all this time his mother’s been dead for years, and he’s walked past her before. Gonna be so emotional either way,"
6798,gameofthrones,Bunch of Frey girls who were jealous they couldn't get in the family probably.

6802,gameofthrones,"If he were given the choice of ruling, he wouldn't be king of Westeros. However the possibility of not having a choice, be it literally or morally speaking, is still a possibility. 

Also, one of the main themes of Jon's character is being the reluctant ruler. That's what makes him a greater ruler than most. "
6803,gameofthrones,"I suppose, if you dont count the night king.. :p"
6804,gameofthrones,"You can always choose Sebastian and everlasting virginity.

My heart yearns for Varric and his glorious chest hair."

6806,gameofthrones,"S2 is tyrion with the blackwater, S4 is tywin. Pic is neat but come on! "
6807,gameofthrones,"That's the impression I got as well. But, if she's in the red keep and went there with the intent to murder.. wouldn't she just have a fresh face on deck so she could just be standing there by the body and be like, ""I saw the little bitch run that way!"""

6833,gameofthrones,"He's a *good* fighter with a very, *very* marked advantage in size and strength. He's not particularly fast, either, but -""quicker than you'd expect for a man of his size"".
He's also extremely well armored; a man of his size and stature can wear heavier armor than what a normal soldier is capable of wearing comfortably.
Add to all of this his substance habit and you've got a monster on your hands -not unbeatable, obviously, as Oberyon was able to achieve a posthumous victory after besting him in single combat (note that Oberyon wore light armor but was otherwise the very much smaller man and not nearly a match on the physical end of things)."

I think they tried to play it like the Lannister's did back in the day. Wait it out, see a victor emerging, and side with them in order to secure ""safety"". 

Unfortunately for the Umbers, it really looked like the Bolton's would win the battle of the bastards, so the Umbers did not betray Ramsey. Queue the arrival of the Knights of the Vale, and suddenly the Umbers are *seriously* regretting their decision. "

6878,gameofthrones,"Olenna definitely wasn't a main character (although her death was very well done), it was pretty obvious that Littlefinger was going to die and we had no emotional bond to Viserion whatsoever, because unlike Drogon he really wasn't very important up until his death (most ""casual"" fans didn't even know which dragon just died)."
6879,gameofthrones,isn't Dorne supposed to be based on the Mediterranean? think of it as taking a vacation in Spain or Italy.
6880,gameofthrones,"Arya became exactly who I wanted her to be, Jon became everything he never imagined, Sansa became what I could never imagine. 

Arya’s my fave but Sansas transformation is by far the most incredible to me. Even her face. She seems to be ready for the world."

6882,gameofthrones,"He was one of the characters I hated. But I started to see him a bit differently when he saved Brienne from being raped. Then the incident where his hand was chopped off, and he became helpless. The turning point was when he turned back to save Brienne from the bear pit. 

Jaime will play a major in Season 8. Especially in coming up with a strategy to face the Night King's massive army."
6883,gameofthrones,"> 2nd to last episode of the 2nd to last season and Jon still knows nothing.

They discovered that killing the White Walker destroys all the wights he created. They then extrapolated that observation to the conclusion that killing the Night King, who created all the White Walkers, would defeat the seemingly impossible to otherwise overcome threat. I liked seeing the scientific method played out rather than just told to them"

He was neglected and left in a field for over 7 years with minimal contact so I don’t exactly know very much about him.

In the show he had Shae genuinely love him, but refused to leave KL with her when she begged her to, because he'd gotten a taste of power and the game of thrones. And in either case it can't have been fun for Shae, getting caught between Tyrion in the one hand and Cersei and Tywin on the other hand. "

People think Tom Hanks is a really nice guy. And maybe he IS, but you don’t know that he is just because he is endearing in Sleepless in Seattle. 

People think Eminem grew up in the ghetto and Kid Rock grew up on a trailer. Again, doesn’t mean they didn’t, but you don’t know they they DID. 

People think Liev Schrieber is a “tough guy” (Sorry, Liev, not saying you’re weak just that I don’t think you parent or settle disagreements quite the way Ray does..) "

6933,gameofthrones,"Only a few Targaryens had polygamous marriages once they moved to Westeros. Since the time of Aegon I's son Maegor they have not been legally recognized because it's considered a sin by the Faith. Despite his Targaryen blood, Jon is considered a bastard by the laws and traditions of Westeros. 

Only the king (or queen) can legally change that and only the Targaryens were able to get away with it because their dragons gave them a lot more pull, but they lost most of that influence with the decline of the dragons. Essentially no ruler alive can get away with it except possibly Dany. I suppose she could retroactively declare Jon's birth legitimate if she conquers as thoroughly as she wants to, but as of now, Jon has no claim to the iron throne except by conquest."

7028,gameofthrones,"> I think it was lack of experience on Dany's part

All that other stuff is IRL issues, of course.  However, if we stick to just the story and what happened, this is it right here.  Dany is super powerful with those dragons, but she's young and inexperienced.  She doesn't listen to good advice from older and wiser advisers.  If she can stop popping off impulsively, she can and will totally kick serious ass in Westeros, but her refusal (inability?) to stop and think about the potential consequences of her actions might just get her and her dragons killed.

I think the scene with Littlefinger where he talks about analyzing every possible outcome in a battle is a nice juxtaposition.  He's come a very long way with this method of winning the Game.  It's almost the exact opposite of Dany's method.  We'll find out in the end which one wins out."

7107,gameofthrones,"It's a tradition - particularly for younger sons. You send the child away to grow up with another high lord (ideally an even more important one), so they have other kids of their status and their age, they can learn about other places and peoples, and so on.

Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark were fostered at the Eyrie. Petyr Baelish's father managed to make friends with Lord Hoster Tully and so was able to have his son fostered at Riverrun (for all the trouble that caused). Edric Storm - one of Robert Baratheon's illegitimate (but highborn) sons was fostered by Renly at Storm's End.

In some ways it's a convenient way of getting an otherwise awkward young child out the way - particularly with Edric (or with all the Freys). In other cases it is about giving the child the best possible start in life by having them raised by a more important Lord."

7151,gameofthrones,"Or he means the odds of not getting killed over that whole time period are super low. Probably the old age thing, but it's possible it was weird wording. "
7152,gameofthrones,"His death is the only one I can't watch.

He would have survived if he didn't start showboating, damnit!"

Sansa: He'll be back.

*Sometime later*

Jon: Bran!

Bran: Hello Jon. I have something to say to you..

Jon: What is it? Tell me please.

Bran: Eh Sheeran's new album just dropped and its out in taverns now. He's touring now and our dear sister got to see him first."
7156,gameofthrones,Love it
7157,gameofthrones,What do you mean by cosplay? You’re the real deal bro!!!

7160,gameofthrones,"She somewhat believed him before too though, Tyrion had partially convinced her. Nothing reallyy changed from the cave scene, she still cautiously believes Jon is telling the truth. The scene was more about Jon and Dany's chemistry and westerosi history imo."

7174,gameofthrones,Does Thoros do anything beside bring back his dead friend? Now Mel got in on that action. But she has so many tricks up her sleeves.
7175,gameofthrones,I guess no one here’s seen “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”
7176,gameofthrones,"I agree, and I think it was really intentional. I think Daeny is out of her element and it's showing. Now, whether that's a good or bad thing is yet to be seen--those who are most ""in their element"" tend to be pretty evil bastards, so perhaps that's where they story's going: you need a little naivety to rule well (or, if Cersei is the last man standing, naivety will get you killed). Jon has certain naivety too, and they project in different ways. 

Daeny doesn't really know how to be a queen. She wasn't brought up in court. She's more or less a child in the ways of the kingdom. So she play-acts it. She sits on the throne, and lists off titles. She's still a child in a lot of ways, and has had to raise herself. 

Jon, on the other hand, knows how to be king, but doesn't trust himself because he was never meant to be a king. He was meant to be a soldier, and has a certain idealism about him (much like Daeny, though tempered through different experiences). 

The contrast was perfect. You have a noble who doesn't know how to be a noble who is pretending as best she can. And you have a soldier who never wanted to be a king keeping himself as simple and human as possible. 

I can't wait until they get married and announced as king and queen. ""This is Daenerys Targaryan, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Ass in the Iron Throne, Slayer of Cersei, Mother of Dragons, the Unburnt, Khaleesi of the Grass Sea, Friendzoner to Mormont, Escaper of Assassins and Kidnappers, Mother of Dragons, Friend of Lizards, Breaker of Chains, Amenable of Occasional Nudity, whose Hair is as Light as her Eyebrows are Dark. And this is Jon Snow. King. King Snow. Stark. This is Jon."" "
7177,gameofthrones,This is beautiful!!! 
7178,gameofthrones,Damn straight! Made me put my grasses right the fuck on.
7179,gameofthrones,....that's hilarious.
7180,gameofthrones,"> I like the idea of Ramsay being delusional to the end, but while I liked most of his acting choices throughout the show, I thought that line should have been delivered with a bit of fear and uncertainty, not raw confidence.

Why is that so strange? The only time he even showed fear in the show was when his father told him about his future baby brother. He immediately resolved that one. The guy was nothing but raw confidence otherwise, even right before he's captured when he claimed they would still be able to hold Winterfell from a siege.

Also he would never show weakness in front of Sansa."

7186,gameofthrones,Child actors are harder to gauge than the Charles Dance's of the world that have a long history of success post maturity 
7187,gameofthrones,"he literally burned the soldiers to ashes and with a blow they are gone in the wind. that's bloody terrifying if you ask me. 

it's almost like bronze age soldiers meets modern day infantry or drones. they're two eras behind. /r/CivPolitics guys can probably make a better analogy than i do. "
7188,gameofthrones,"As far as Political Marriages go it makes sense. It allows Jon to stay King and save face with his vassals, and it binds the North, and to a lesser extent, the Vale and Riverlands to her. That and for the Targaryans being that closely related is actually a plus."
7189,gameofthrones,That faceless men theory is absurd
7190,gameofthrones,"Some show!only watchers actually thought they were gonna make out apparently.

"
7191,gameofthrones,"I'm surprised that anyone but Jaime would let Tyrion anywhere near them for this picture.

Also, this is amazing!"
7192,gameofthrones,"I'm British and I still find it weird how many of our actors are one percenters. Acting is a privileged profession, for sure, but the silver spoon prevalence is through the roof. Hiddleston, Cumberbatch and Harington to name a few. "
7193,gameofthrones,This is perfect. The only way it'll be better is if you made one where the mod (Jon) stares down the huge influx of shit posts  (Bolton cavalry charging at him)
7194,gameofthrones,Other than speculating on the outfits (e.g. Dani wearing red and black) and talking about the locations of each's stronghold... the trailer didn't really do much except exude total bad-ass.   But somehow he'd find a way to make a 10 minute video out of it.

7206,gameofthrones,Uncanny 
7207,gameofthrones,"According to the books, no, 


the magic horn would have been used by the night king and it would have broken the magic enchantments that held back the at of the dead before

7215,gameofthrones,"Also, Jon seemed to burn his hand when he was defending Mormont from the wight at Castle Black."
7216,gameofthrones,Not an actual Queen and not even a Tyrell by blood.
7217,gameofthrones,"Don't forget the Hound, one of my favorites!  That is the brilliance of George RR Martin and I why I loved the series so much. Very few characters are black or white.  The Hound murdered the innocent butcher's boy, after all. Credit to HBO for so effectively casting and portraying the characters. "
7218,gameofthrones,"Why the fuck is this being downvoted. It's an opinion guys. 
"
7219,gameofthrones,"I just love that castles are clearly inspired by different regions. Riverrun looks like some Polish or Eastern European castle. And Eyrie looks like Byzantine castle, with palace exactly like basilicas in Constantinople. "
7220,gameofthrones,Pompeii and the Fall of Rome seem like good places to start. Or maybe the eruption at Thera which ended the Minoan civilization and the same event that some think gave rise to the myth of ^^^^Stargate [Atlantis](http://orig11.deviantart.net/cf1f/f/2014/007/7/1/stargate_atlantis_city_2014___cam__3_by_coldilian-d718kvk.png)

7223,gameofthrones,"I was actually pretty chuffed when Cersei blew up the sept, when a show can make this absolute cunthammer of a character then make you root for her, then its a good show."
7224,gameofthrones,"You notice how you never see jaqen, ned, or the nights king in the same scene?"
7225,gameofthrones,I would love a spin off that focused more on lowborn.
7226,gameofthrones,"Exactly how I feel. 

I couldn't wait for the three of them to grow up. The anticipation was kiiiillling me! 
From the second I saw those newborn baby dragons, I was imagining scenes just like the bottom one.

In hindsight it seems quick, but experiencing it from the beginning.....seemed to take FOREEEEVER.

The last 9 episodes are gonna be insane"
7227,gameofthrones,"He has been rowing around Westeros for 3 seasons. Dude must have a ripped upper body now.

Edit: I can't english."
7228,gameofthrones,"Shay was goddamn annoying, every single scene ""I'm not your whore blah blah blah""

Guess she wasn't, she was tywin's. Side question, were they fucking before tyrion was locked up or was she moving on and doing what she thought she had to do to survive?"
7229,gameofthrones,"Yeah, and Cersei starts getting fat and bloated in the books too and is in serious denial about it.

Then again the character of Cersei was made much nicer and significantly more cunning in the show than she is in the books.

Or at least her actress makes her come off as much more capable than she really is. In the books she's utterly cruel and dumb, just like Joff."
7230,gameofthrones,"Darn, was looking forward to reading your stuff this season! Cheers for all the good content over the years!"
7231,gameofthrones,"That's actually a good theory. The last thing that was said before somehow convincing her to agree is ""you're pregnant"" so we can assume whatever the fuck he said had something to do with her unborn child. I can't think of too many reasons why beyond what you said. Good call. "
7232,gameofthrones,Yes
7233,gameofthrones,"To be fair, when faced with a choice between:

A) You daughter is sacrificed to a cruel god, however you are granted the ability to save the world and fulfill your destiny, and therefore restore justice to the land.

or

B) You daughter survives, however you and her both later die, as well as the rest of the world.

I would go for the greater good ([The greater good!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUpbOliTHJY))"
7234,gameofthrones,"What I read in some interview was that CGI for hairy animals is crazy expensive and the show has a set budget, and they had to choose, since every minute of ghost hanging around in the background near Jon was as expensive to film as five minutes of dragons flying, so they chose to go with more dragons and less ghost."
7235,gameofthrones,Game of Tones
7236,gameofthrones,This would look great displayed on a nice board of stained oak. Help to give contrast.
7237,gameofthrones,But... where are the Boltons?
7238,gameofthrones,"I'm honestly wondering if the show is going to remove the entire PTWP and Azor Ahai storylines from the show. You think they'd have shoehorned in a few references to it in earlier seasons if they were going to go that direction.

I hope they don't cut out the storylines entirely but it might feel a bit *deus ex machina*-y to introduce the idea with only six episodes left. "
7239,gameofthrones,That r squared value 😩
7240,gameofthrones,"a little late, but I suspect you could always go to the red carpet event, knock out Emilia Clarke and take her place with no one none the wiser. "

7249,gameofthrones,"As far as Jon/The Starks know, Jamie and Cersei pushed Bran then sent an assassin after him. Plus it all started with John Arryn being poisoned, which they probably still blame the Lannisters for."

7260,gameofthrones,"You think The Hound would express this pride? Fuck no. Just like Arya would never admit she cares for The Hound. They would never throw their arms around each other and cry and grovel and tell each other they missed each other. That's the beauty of their relationship. They so very clearly care, but are simply incapable of showing it."
7261,gameofthrones,Can somebody eli5 what happened exactly. So was bran acting as a telephone into the past right?
7262,gameofthrones,"Ok, I love the attention to detail (Tyrion's arrow, Cersei's children, Jamies' glove) but it really irks me that Jamies' sword is on the wrong side already."

Not sure why there's a society of assassins in Essos that desire to become him, though."
7281,gameofthrones,Yeah he wasn't actually invincible but he felt that way.  And was kinda as close as a mortal man can get.
7282,gameofthrones,"> I think she does it because she thinks that's what a ruler does, by having so many titles she becomes more legitimate and more like a proper ruler

That is like a lot of the things she does. 

When she sits on the throne in Meeren shes stiff and informal. When shes in the fighting pits she shows no emotion, just stiff formality. When she was in season one she switched to ordering people around in the Khalasar because they follow strength. Her clothes have always been a representation of her presenting an image she needs everyone to see for political reasons. 

When talks to Jon she has to impress that feeling of ""Queen"". Dany has never been around real leaders, the only thing she knows is how to project an armour of alpha dominance. She is very much into embracing the trappings of power and Jon inspite of being King, has never done that, they even joked that he doesnt have a crown. "
7283,gameofthrones,I never really thought that until the last season of parks and rec. Then I realized I’m an idiot. Or maybe it was the episode she was trying to get Ron to talk to her when they were locked in the old parks department. She made me laugh so much that I realized funny women are hot!
7284,gameofthrones,"I feel this way about the whole ""Sam is the true hero of LOTR"" stuff too even if Tolkien himself said it. There's so many people and things that contribute to the cause that I think it's so dumb people try to make Sam Tarly/Gamgee the one true hero of their stories"
7285,gameofthrones,"Like someone else said I was referring to that scene where the faces were ripped off in quick succession. Also, while Arya may very well have hallucinated that bit my point still stands in that we don't really know how anything works. "

That movie is a car crash in slow motion but she is just very wooden in it. I think Lena should have been submitted instead. She carries the scenes that she is in and she has shown a wide range of emotions. There are times were you are somewhat sympathetic to her and then in the next scene, hate her guts."

7334,gameofthrones,"Well we're ahead of the books at this point so we don't know. Jon isn't really focused on Kings Landing at the moment because the North is impossible to conquer during winter time. Any army marching up would first have to get to the Neck, which is controlled by the Crannogmen. If the army can get through that, they would have to get past Moat Cailin, which is impossible to besiege from the South. If they can somehow get through that, they would starve/freeze to death before even making it to Winterfell. Jon would have to do literally nothing to repel an invasion.

Dany isn't coming for Jon, don't really know where you're getting that. Her army would freeze to death up there and her dragons wouldn't be able to occupy any castles. If Dany is smart, she'll take Kings Landing and leave the North alone until Winter is done, which is what I would do. "

It'll be similar to season 7 with the shit writing, but it'll be entertaining as hell."
7341,gameofthrones,54 MB GIF.....Mother Of Lord
7342,gameofthrones,The unshaven
7343,gameofthrones,You lack knowledge of The Force.
7344,gameofthrones,Do you have the artist source for this?
7345,gameofthrones,"That's his chin in the frame, right?

... Definitely not his balls?"
7346,gameofthrones,"I got a two for one deal on the internet at the time and i don't remember what it cost. They give you a sub zero sleeping bag and teach you how to use them and stay warm. They also provide some food, a complimentary alcoholic drink, and i think i remember robes and towels for the sauna. "
7347,gameofthrones,"The whole time, I kept telling my husband that she spoke Valerian. I was certain she had before. He argued that it must have a different language because why would she let him talk about her like that if she could understand! This part was doubly great because I got to be right!"
7348,gameofthrones,Damn right
7349,gameofthrones,"Yeah no I understand that, I'm just talking about his outfit, he's legit wearing Geralt's clothes"
7350,gameofthrones,"/r/tsgh

I don't know if it's a reference but this is the only place i see gifs like this."
7351,gameofthrones,"I needed to see this scene again after he mentioned it.

[Here](https://youtu.be/O8ES_ElI6Wg?t=2m11s) it is for others."
7352,gameofthrones,Does this make The Hound a Saber?
7353,gameofthrones,"Nice try, Natalie Dormer."
7354,gameofthrones,"I see two possibilities. 

1- Littlefinger convinces Sansa (or Sansa is on the same page as Littlefinger) and they fuck up Winterfell. 

2- Littlefinger is manipulated by Sansa, we don't know it, but she screws him in a last minute turnaround. 

In either cases, Arya takes Littlefinger's face and goes to Cersei. "
7355,gameofthrones,"Oh Evan, ha ha.  Remember that time you sucked off three guys and ine shat on your chest?  Those were the days. 😂🤣 "

7359,gameofthrones,"Not that great a read honestly, but it does do a good job of holding my screen door shut in the wind."
7360,gameofthrones,"Watch *Firefly*. IMO, the greatest thing Whedon has ever given us."
7361,gameofthrones,"Such an intense scene. 

I really need to find the time to start from the beginning. "
7362,gameofthrones,"So much rice water, just drink real beer people."
7363,gameofthrones,Quite the coldest cold open. 
7364,gameofthrones,"To be fair, if you saw your little brother running for his life across an empty field while being shot at, would you really do things differently?

I'm in the camp of it's Sansa's fault for not telling him about the damned Vale"
7365,gameofthrones,Yes
7366,gameofthrones,"Every little bit saves VFX time and money.  They appreciate the practical assistance, I assure you."
7367,gameofthrones,"Even though the scenes look dire and intense, the music felt like it belonged to a musical which felt really out of place. But then the sequence of the explosion happened and it felt like a celebration for Cersei. Then that Tommen scene happened and the music changed. It was perfectly executed omg."
7368,gameofthrones,"Led by Genghis Khal, no doubt."
7369,gameofthrones,Bringing pizza was a smart move. You can get into anywhere with pizza

7374,gameofthrones,"And what it should be is a mix of both - bittersweet like GRRM said. That's what GoT is about - we have things like Ned's death and Red Wedding, but we also get Joffrey's death and Battle of the Bastards (and Ramsay's subsequent death)."

7381,gameofthrones,"This. Women in refrigerators is a stupid, lazy trope. When Ramsay rapes Sansa, it's not her pain we're led to focus on but Theon's. It will be transformative for him, the catalyst for him. Cersei is not shown to be affected at all by Jamie, but it is a profound expression of loss by him.

Long pattern of the GoT writers doing a shitty job of making women any more than tits and martyrs for men when they diverge from source material."
7382,gameofthrones,How do know he wasn't born in 1932 and is named Cleveland Brown? 
7383,gameofthrones,No. 
7384,gameofthrones,My damn roommate won’t watch it even though the rest of the house has and all our friends have and we all love it. One like = one prayer.
7385,gameofthrones,"I think Jon becomes the night king, sacrifices himself."
7386,gameofthrones,You want this to be *actually* realistic you need to get rid of that woman's eyebrows. Her hair is naturally silver she ain't gonna have dark brown eyebrows.
7387,gameofthrones,Hey I got those for my secret Santa 
7388,gameofthrones,"Mountain, Jaime, 5 kingsguard?"
7389,gameofthrones,"Oh I was impressed by Cersei's servant sporting the same haircut too. Dedication! Giving your life is one thing, but cutting your lucious locks to appease her grace. Dilemma."
7390,gameofthrones,"And there seem to be a lot of people on here who don't get that it's a joke. I am rather tired of people pulling out the ""Gendry could be *anywhere*"" stuff to justify the bizarre, even by tinfoil standards."
7391,gameofthrones,hahaha im surprised this comment took as long as it did
7392,gameofthrones,It can turn a man into a king. 
7393,gameofthrones,"In a natural hive, they're in a different part than the honey. "
7394,gameofthrones,"If I recall correctly, Tyrion gave him about 6 bitcoins. Back in the early days of 2018 that was a lot of money. Some say it still is."
7395,gameofthrones,"You think us Fleabottomers know how to pronounce ""vernacular""? That's a fancy word for fancy cunts. "
7396,gameofthrones,Yeah nothing upsetting ever happens in GoT
7397,gameofthrones,"I'm in.

"
7398,gameofthrones,"First question every time, ""are you still alive?"""
7399,gameofthrones,"When I rewatch the show I honestly skip so much of the Ramsay stuff because it's just too much for me. Even knowing what happens, too much tension."
7400,gameofthrones,Maybe he assumed he was too drunk to remember.
7401,gameofthrones,Yeah when you watch the first episode in Netflix you get to see a nice set.

7405,gameofthrones,Don't you think she has always been a bit mad? I mean she has been in a romantic relationship with her twin brother most of her life. 
7406,gameofthrones,"Wow
Never thought I would need this. "
7407,gameofthrones,Or Littlefinger ;)
7408,gameofthrones,"My GF (I live with her) with watched ALL. OF. HIMYM. That show... it has it’s moments, but a lot of the time I wanted to blow my brains out. Ted Mosby is the most annoying sitcom star I’ve ever seen. "
7409,gameofthrones,"O' Ramsey Bolton,
Who chopped off dicks and raped chicks,
Eaten by his dogs
"
7410,gameofthrones,"The biggest way his story is influenced by real history is the humanity behind the events. That's the part that intrigues me the most.

Everyone can read about the Norman Conquest of England, but it takes a serious history buff to recognize all the forces in play and the level of humanity that spurred the outcome we had. If you know of the parameters, you can know if you tuned some parameters a little bit differently the world could have turned out in a different way, and showing these parameters and lifting them up in the saga is what makes Game Of Thrones what is in my view. For example, the character behind the person that is Cersei Lannister, and how her character shapes the story and the world as a whole. It's amazing."
7411,gameofthrones,"""Dragons are now replaced with walkie-talkies""

7416,gameofthrones,Hey its me ur Arya
7417,gameofthrones,Brutal!
7418,gameofthrones,That is a very unusual spoiler. I think the title is incorrect. Does this spoil the plot? Or provide DEADLY DOWNFORCE for this Toyota Corolla?
7419,gameofthrones,"I would love to see Ramsey meeting Wun Wun, I bet it would be like that bit in the Avengers with Loki and the Hulk."
7420,gameofthrones,"She could also have done a great little bear mormont! (Also amazing John snow, don't get me wrong)"
7421,gameofthrones,Probably. But if the season ends with the rampage just starting. I'll be upset.
7422,gameofthrones,I bought a shirt with this design for myself and a friend for Christmas last year.  It's one of my favorites.

[Everything](#b ""Regarding Tyrion, well he played some game with Jon/Dany in s7. It did not work out too well, he finally had to realize that J/D are together, in love, whatever. Tyrion could not stop that. And now he feels either envious or worried about it. Both seems to make sense, he wishes for all the best with J/D, but also envies those who find real love. He has struggled all his life to do the same."")"
7437,gameofthrones,Titts & Dragons is all I want. 
7438,gameofthrones,"He also saw the sea swallowing Winterfell, with maester luwin and sir rodrick drowning (greyjoys)."
7439,gameofthrones,"You are correct, season 2 was nowhere near the masterpiece that was the *true* True Detective, but I watched the whole thing and it did have many redeeming elements and is still better than the majority of stuff in TV. In particular the character arcs and acting to complement it. But if you stopped after the third episode then you stopped one episode too soon. If you got that far in you really owe yourself to at least watch the fourth episode. That one was good enough to be worth a watch even if you don't finish the season after that."
7440,gameofthrones,If this what you've spent 4 years doing???
7441,gameofthrones,"Cersei came here to kick ass and love her children, and she's all outta children!"
7442,gameofthrones,"This is why I love the internet and this subreddit in particular. I know some people don't like these sorts of posts, but these sorts of posts always make me chuckle."
7443,gameofthrones,Filming a two hour long sex scene is very tiring as well.
7444,gameofthrones,"She believed it because Jon Snow and Jeor Mormont did. 

I'm sure she got word that Jon Snow was LC and probably even that he was Mormont's steward. That counts for something as far as credibility goes. When someone credible tells you they saw it first hand, you believe it."
7445,gameofthrones,Can someone tell me how this is different from the Sansa cosplay that is being bashed in another thread? If this is a clip from a makeup tutorial to look like Daenerys I'd say she did an awesome job but as cosplay... not so sure. I wish I could see an actual costume rather than a simple black dress.
7446,gameofthrones,if a raven can fly 2000 miles in 6hours i think a dragon can do warp speed.
7447,gameofthrones,"Oh shit, I had no idea :("
7448,gameofthrones,"I salute you, Lord Commander."
7449,gameofthrones,But the reason people like Game of Thrones is that it's unpredictable. They enjoy trying to figure out what'll happen next. There would be no surprises in a Robert's Rebellion movie. 
7450,gameofthrones,Parks and rec
7451,gameofthrones,Yeah I kind of think they were paying homage to The Princess Bride with that one. I didn't see his death coming though. Great scene nontheless.

7462,gameofthrones,"Jaime was 15 when he took the white and was over-awed by his situation. But he had to be refrained from stopping the King from hurting the Queen by the other Kingsguard. And he would have likely survived in the Red Keep from the wildfire, but was horrified at the prospect of the city on fire. He had far more honor than the rest of the Kingsguard that stood by and watched, as grown men, their King descend into insanity and drag the kingdom with him. "
7463,gameofthrones,He'll make a hell of an offtank.

7467,gameofthrones,Why do people sell them for so low? Are they using machines or labor from countries where 5 pounds is a lot? 
7468,gameofthrones,"Holy fuck that Jaime - Cersei scene was extremely tense. I legit thought she was going to order him to be executed, especially considering she refused to kill one brother before, it would have been sadly poetic if she killed the one she actually loved."
7469,gameofthrones,"Hm there's more commonalities between Tyrion and Bloodraven than I would have expected. They were born with uncommon medical conditions that were likely to inspire superstition. Hands of the King, facial disfigurement... I don't believe Tyrion is a Targ bastard though :)

7477,gameofthrones,"Dude I read these books before the show and let me tell you, that they're not really being written anymore is by far the biggest let down in my reading career.  Grrm is one of if not the best author I've ever had the pleasure of reading and he's stylistically my absolute favorite.  His use of foreshadowing and prose is just phenomenal.  I remember reading the chapter he introduced Oberyn Martell  (the fat guy with gout, I may have the name wrong it's been years) he paralleled the house with the falling overripe blood oranges and I was just amazed at how well written it was that I read it again.  Really hope the books still come out.

Edit: a word"
7478,gameofthrones,"I didn't see that coming.. I expected Jamie to kill Walder. Or even thought for a moment that he was going mad or blind (maybe poisoned). I am not good at anticipating that kind of stuff. XD

Arya really surprised me. Didn't expect her to be in Westeros already. Maybe sneaking onto a ship or something."
7479,gameofthrones,Omg do more! Hopefully you'll do one of Jaime :D
7480,gameofthrones,I wish Theon could get nominated 
7481,gameofthrones,This reminds me of the animations idea to tell the story of the Deathly Hallows in HP!
7482,gameofthrones,"When it happened I was totally surprised he was the one to delegate according to each person's strength, not a skill I thought if he had he would care enough to use. "
7483,gameofthrones,"It's in the books.  In the third novel *A Storm of Swords* [a Kraken is reported to have pulled down an Ibbenese trading galley](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Krakens) somewhere near the fingers.  It's possible this is just heraldry about Euron Crow's eye I'll admit, but Krakens are mentioned throughout the books as being just as 'non-existent' as living dragons.  "
7484,gameofthrones,I think we just figured out how he'll defeat the Night King
7485,gameofthrones,"Larger timbers/rafters are actually fairly fire resistant.  The outside layer chars and then essentially acts as a fire-resistant layer.  A decent 8x8 timber will have a fire rating of over an hour.  Smaller rafters would have lasted long enough for her to get out.

I mean, I assume Dothraki building codes aren't as good as ours, but the physics are the same.  Any falling material was probably just falling thatch and smaller sticks.  Might have hurt, but not killed her."

7487,gameofthrones,"You realise that Mel is the only player aware of the threat of the Others, and that everything she has done was for the purpose of saving westeros. She thinks that Stannis is the prophesied hero, and is helping him gain power so that he can lead in the 'great war'."
7488,gameofthrones,"I'd assume they'd be extremely prone to infection without skin, so the problem would probably take care of itself after not too long."
7489,gameofthrones,"6 thrones. Could be a hint to the kingdoms. Who is still in play now in GOT's? Spoilerific from this point on.

So the seats of the current/remaining leaders are Kings Landing, Winterfell, The Iron Islands, Dorne (Although theyre all but out at this point but one highly vengeful mother is still alive as far as we know) Dragonstone and the Whitewalkers/Night King. 

Interchanged with Dorne could be Oldtown and the Citadel and with what Sam Tarly knows as a 6th party actually seems more likely to me now then Dorne which are pretty much done.

I'd be interested to see if you lined up the 6 locations of the thrones whether they'd line up with locations in Westeros if overlayed on a map."
7490,gameofthrones,Shit. The best ideas always come after uploading the comic.
7491,gameofthrones,if his best friend isn't a king of something I'd be upset. 
7492,gameofthrones,"Well, not if he would have run serpentine, but then Ramsay probably would have just told all his archers to fire a volley, and then yes, he was fucked. "

7494,gameofthrones,"It hasn't been that cold here lately, but I like that it suits the weather, and that it's different than what we usually see while still being canon. "
7495,gameofthrones,"How is it worse?

I think time zones are an over complicated “solution” to a total non-issue. 

We should just have one universal Earth time.  And we do; it’s called UTC.

The origins story of time zones is dumb af.  People on railroads started to realize that “hey! 9am in NY is daylight, but 9am in CA is dark!”  Yup.  And that’s where the discussion should end.  Who cares?  Economy can just develop based on the fact that the sun rises at 10am.

Instead we developed a non-universally adopted system of setting back clocks based on arbitrarily drawn lines.  Not every country uses it consistently and the lines are not agreed upon.  

Just so we can have a consistent experience of “what 8am should feel like.”  We should do away with time zones and daylight savings time altogether. 

Edit: this video sums up why I think it’s a big nuisance. https://youtu.be/uW6QqcmCfm8"
7496,gameofthrones,They probably told him he was going to be doing that nude scene with Miranda and he was like fuuuuuuck I need to lay off those fatty sausages and hit the gym!
7497,gameofthrones,"Been years since I read that book as well but I remember more being described and happening. However it was described in the book, it definitely had a much larger impact. 

The dudes were going to kill Sam and the chapter ended with one  guy pissing his pants when he heard the horn.  Might have been the prologue? I can't remember. Then in a later chapter I kinda remember the Night's Watch running, being attacked and slaughtered... and an undead bear. "

7504,gameofthrones,"I can totally relate! I'm the dorkiest dork and I cosplayed Seven of Nine from Star Trek: Voyager. In the end I still grinned in most of the pictures because it was just too hard not to (especially since we met Jeri Ryan - Seven of Nine herself - and other super fun stars). But we also did a performance on stage where I was in character, and it wasn't easy to not smile even for the 4 minutes or so. BTW, I also did it with my girlfriend, she was Kathryn Janeway. :)"
7505,gameofthrones,Kit looks like Ted Mosby 
7506,gameofthrones,"I don't think GRRM has ever been subtle about this. He foreshadowed it in the books plenty. I'm certainly not against the pairing. I wonder if this is a fruitation of a lot of things. Obviously R+L=J, Dany's visions and the ""curse"", old pacts between the Starks and Targaryens aka the Pact of Ice and Fire which never happened. 

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pact_of_Ice_and_Fire

Just saying Dany ain't a queen yet she is still a princess until crowned. Jon currently is Lord and head of the Stark house."
7507,gameofthrones,"I mean, I get that time passed and all that but you must admit it was a little jarring having Varys in Dorne, Dany in Mereen, and then both Dany and Varys show up at the end of the episode together sailing across the Narrow Sea in the span of forty minutes and with absolutely no transitional scene in between.

It's not so much about it not making sense, as it is crammed into one episode. "

7512,gameofthrones,"The original reason objectification started to get restricted was that people were posting Jon+Arya R34 porn and real photos of barely-covered-but-nude underage girls who just happened to look like Sophie Turner.  This was years ago, and just before Reddit banned /r/jailbait and related subreddits.  We're not here to moderate porn, and we didn't want the sub to get banned.  Since then there have been dozens of situations where certain users have tried to push the limits, play rules-lawyer, or similar trolling efforts.  The rules have gotten more simple/general as a result.  You can thank the trolls for why we can't have nice things.

These days it's also about general content quality.  Do you really want to dig through dozens of masturbation jokes to get to a relevant comment?  The books are for adults.  The show is for adults.  It's not a big jump to believe the sub should have a similar level of maturity.  

> Part of why the show is enjoyable to watch is the gratuitous nudity. Why are people not allowed to talk about it?

You can search back through the posts and find many, many topics that do talk about the nudity, sex, rape scenes, sexposition, etc.  Those are perfectly legit topics that are about the show.  The only thing that's not ok are comments from redditors saying they want to bang the actors.  There's nothing original with that.  Those comments don't add value to the discussions.  Shitposting in general isn't allowed either.

7564,gameofthrones,"This one was apparently a disaster, apart from a few scenes. After they were criticized by some friend of theirs, D&D heavily changed their vision of the show and decided to make it much less complicated and confusing for the general audiences."
7565,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I don't know why everybody seems to want the plot spelled out for them. If they just explain everything that happens directly, it'd be dumbed down and boring. No excitement, no speculation. Why do people want that?"

Granted, the show is playing it increasingly fast and loose with travel time, so who knows. But I've always been curious/frustrated with Dany's strategy in that regard. If she means to take Westeros, it would be virtually impossible to keep a firm grip Slaver's Bay while simultaneously mounting a full scale invasion of an entire continent. Even if she had the biggest army that Planetos has ever seen, it would be absurdly difficult. "

7749,gameofthrones,I've only done a few. I did dragon rider when I was younger. Maybe 12?  Fairy with a broken wing (I wear this one to the ren faire every year at least once) Oracle and Cersei. This one is my favorite by far. 
7750,gameofthrones,The Stark-Baratheon wedding that was promised!
7751,gameofthrones,"""The day you were born, your mom bled to death... and looked pretty doing it."""
7752,gameofthrones,Yes 
7753,gameofthrones,I always thought Joffrey was based on Nero not Caligula. Nero was Aggrippina's son and I'm pretty sure Cersei is supposed to be Aggrippina and Tyrion is supposed to be Claudius.

7758,gameofthrones,"The whole reason why GRRM's dragons are more similar to Wyverns is because he thinks it is silly to have only one species on a planet that evolved to have 6 limbs when all else have four. Zero to two is possible, limbs can disappear as it did with snakes. 6 or 8 is possible if the species mutated in the past, but it isn't likely and it doesn't sound like something GRRM would create based on his thoughts on dragons. If sources vary it is more likely that someone made some shit up."

7768,gameofthrones,"I thought all those nameless foreign folk were considered the bad guys because they were slavers, trying to steal her dragons, imprison her, or otherwise conspiring against her.  She was freeing slaves, telling them they're free to choose to live how they want.   While the people of the north had done nothing but choose Jon for their king of their own free will.  She didn't like the choice of these free people and deemed them all enemies.  She won't be freeing slaves if she starts a war with the north.  She's claiming this is her right because historically the northern houses swore to her family's name.  She wants to hold people accountable for their family, while saying she shouldn't be held accountable for hers."

For I have the PRIDE, the PRIVILEGE, nay the PLEASURE of introducing to you a king sired by kings who can trace his lineage back... beyond Brandon Stark. 

I first met him atop the Wall at Castle Black PRAYING to the GODS for forgiveness for the Wildling blood spilled by his sword. NEXT he amazed me still further in Winterfell where he saved a foulless beauty from the ravishings of her dreadful bastard husband! He once spent a few days completely dead to better understand the words... Of the Stranger...

And SO, without further GILDING THE LILY and with NO MORE ADO, I give to you, THE PROTRCTOR OF NORTHERN VIRGINITY, THE LAST OF THE BASTARDS, he GAVE THEM HELL at WINTERFELL. The RESSURECTED of our LORD OF LIGHT. The ONNNEEEEE. THE ONNNNLYYYY.

7801,gameofthrones,Have you listened to BobbyChiu’s the perfect bait?
7802,gameofthrones,"Have you ever heared of the race to the south pole? Basically, horses are fucking horrible in this climate. A few points:

Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.

Ponies' coats easily became soaked with perspiration during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.

The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant seal and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.

TL:DR Horses are absolutley useless in this climate and would be more hindering than helpful."
7803,gameofthrones,He needed to destroy Jon's army. Hiding behind the walls would not have helped do that.

There is no reason why phenomena which is not explicitly meant to be derivative of reality cannot be more or less congruent with our world. 

In my opinion, it is the thought-through, realistic aspects of fiction (yes, even fantasy) which create immersion. 

There might not be any way to justify a large creature breathing fire using real-world physics, but there is no real reason to think such a creature would not need to eat, is there? We see Dany's dragons eat, why should it be any different for Balerion? "
7888,gameofthrones,"I just realized why the photo of Jon bothers me. 

Ned is leaning forward but his elbows are resting on his knees. His pose is in a relaxed exhausted looking pose. 

Jon is too short to do that (or he’s sitting too far back in the chair.  Instead of looking casual he’s crouched down by his sword hilt. To me it looks exaggerated, like cosplay or a little kid trying to look cool, & and I don’t think that was the intention. 

It’s a pet peeve of mine through when I see people leaning on their naked swords like that. I keep thinking ‘come on that can’t be good for the tip!’ 

I get what they were trying to do, but I don’t think this is Kit’s best ‘power pose’. "

7891,gameofthrones,"Symbolism of them loosing their Stark connection? :S

Sansa lost hers, became broken and now once again carries a direwolf on her dress in S6E5 (She found herself again?)
Robb = Self explanatory? 
"
7892,gameofthrones,">  so why does Night King-Bran try to kill Jon when it won't amount to anything?

Knowing the outcome isn't enough to cause it, they still have to perform the actions.  E.g. if the Night King just sat back and chilled and didn't pursue Jon and Co. or threaten them then perhaps Daenerys wouldn't see the threat for what it was, etc etc."

Thus the difference between a baby and a corpse.  

I guess it kind of bothers me that so many people aren't able to grasp the difference between ""something living"" and ""something dead"".  If the Night King could make corpses into White Walkers, why wouldn't he have an *entire army* of White Walkers?  What would be the point of *ever* creating the crappy Zombie versions?

7940,gameofthrones,"I think that's what happened but the way it was shot in no way is that clear.  It's pretty ambiguous if they lived or not, which I think means that they're alive and they gave us enough to assume how they lived, but the shot was pretty ambiguous on the matter, probably intentionally so."

7942,gameofthrones,"Really looking forward to next week's scene of Sam and Gilly traveling to Winterfell so Sam can get back to Jon and the battle with the WW.

Sam: ""We need to hurry up and get back to Winterfell so I can pour through these texts and see if there is any way to stop the White Walkers. I really wish the Maesters had listened to me.""

Gilly: ""Hmm. It says here that Sir Authur Martin of the house Ravenswatch once defeated the entire Army of the dead by killing its Night King with dragonglass with a direct shot to the heart in a one-on-one fight.""

Sam: ""I just don't understand why they wouldn't listen to me. I have a lot of knowledge and it can really save all of us.""

Gilly: ""Interesting. I just read that the army of the dead has a hive mind and all it takes it three drops of king's blood burned in a fire to get them to freeze in place, making it impossibly easy to kill the Night's Kind and render the entire army obsolete.""

Sam: ""Obsolete. That's what I felt like Gilly. They wouldn't even take me serious. It's like no one respects me, you know. No one ever pays attention to me.""

Sam Jr: ""God damn it uncle/dad, would you listen to mom?!?!?!?!!?""

EDIT: Wow, this blew up and is now my top comment. I look forward to humorlessly trying to recreate this for the next two years and failing miserably ever single time. Thanks lads!"
7943,gameofthrones,"I agree. It would be completely out of character for Brienne to fall for a man like Tormund. She is obsessed with honor, oaths, knighthood; all things Tormund despises and would spit on."
7944,gameofthrones,Night king was up in there. Clap him and it’s lullaby time for the AOTD

I remember a post where people discussed her acting abilities and there wasn't exactly a definite majority. I tried to find the thread for you, but all I could find were links to some porn the actress once did lol. Should tell you something about her acting as well."

7957,gameofthrones,The Russians did this in WWII. A bunch of them would lay on their backs and fire upwards at low flying aircraft with their Mosin Nagants. One guy isn't gonna do much but 1-200 rifles is bound to score some kind of hit. They even used them like short range artillery. Get a bunch of dudes to volley shots in the general direction of a threat. There's a reason those rifles had their sights so unrealistically graduated out to 2000 yards.

7978,gameofthrones,"Dude, seriously get off Reddit and start reading the books (and other texts) and then rewatch the show and then get back on r/got and r/asoiaf. I'm not trying to be rude, but reading posts and theories before you read the books is ruining a lot for yourself"
7979,gameofthrones,Me too. It's such a shame they desecrated the Martell and the dornish storyline in the TV series.
7980,gameofthrones,"I've always found Robert's Rebellion and the Fall of the Targs to be ripe for an adaptation.   
If HBO wants to keep making money with the series, it seems more than likely that Robert's Rebellion will be their first choice for a spin-off mini-series/movie.  

Dunk & Egg would make a great mini-series too."

7985,gameofthrones,The power of makeup. I don't know if I'll ever understand it lol.
7986,gameofthrones,"She makes a big deal of her connection to the Iron Bank, playing up the fact that she learned about gold from their father, even though I think that was her biggest screw-up yet. There's a reason Tywin didn't pay the Iron Bank back; he'd have gotten that gold together somehow if he really wanted to. Cersei basically just gave the Iron Bank permission to wash their hands of her, the contract was complete. Why would they side with her against the obviously more powerful Targaryan? They're crappy speculators, if Tycho Nestoris couldn't meet with Cersei for that long and not become aware of how fragile her power is."
7987,gameofthrones,"Fellow Bear Islanders,  if you have any kids maybe sit down and watch Hilda (netflix). Our Lady Mormont voices the main character and is still a badass."

7990,gameofthrones,Hard to believe there's only one left. I remember the year-long wait for season 2. Then 3. Then 4. And so on. This series has been part of our lives for 8 years.

7993,gameofthrones,Watching Winds of Winter rn and I’ve been waiting for this the whole time. To cry again like a little bitch for the four the time around when the camera changes from baby Aegon to Jon Snow. My heart can’t take this. I need more than 8 seasons.
7994,gameofthrones,That's just how she always looks. Surprised the duppers haven't tried to burn her at the stake yet. 
7995,gameofthrones,"Didn't hear many grunts in Dunkirk, though."
7996,gameofthrones,"Except Jon’s not Batman, I don’t see how Ramsay could’ve expected to live in any scenario. I don’t know just seems like it’d be a better move to kill Jon, just my opinion."

She sensed the growing distance between them, but still needs Jaime to fight her war. The easiest most sure way to bind him to her cause is to tie his unborn child to her fate."

8024,gameofthrones,the cut away from the baby to Jon's face... I lost it
8025,gameofthrones,"That's not true. I guess there's more main character rape but there was way more regular rape in the books. Pia getting put in the stocks naked and raped by anybody that passes. Lollys Stokeworth literally gets raped by 50 men during the riot in KL. There's that poor serving girl that gets raped by the Mountain and his men at that inn. 



Those are just the ones that stand out really. They also really stress how basically every woman in the Riverlands gets raped during the war."
8026,gameofthrones,That’s what she said
8027,gameofthrones,"I’m rewatching the show I just noticed during joffery’s wedding, Lady Tyrrel grabbed a stone off of Sanaa’s necklace when she’s talking about how pretty she is. Low and behold, the Goblet was left unattended right by her before he died. I never noticed it, until this second time through!"
8028,gameofthrones,While interesting it does spoil the magic somewhat
8029,gameofthrones,why is this tagged spoilers?
8030,gameofthrones,Was a bit of a cunt early on as well so she made some hurdles.
8031,gameofthrones,You monster. 
8032,gameofthrones,"I don't think so, simply for the reason Jon actively does not want power, and does not believe he is the best one.

I still fundamentally think Dany's arc is about her learning to be The Good Queen. For all Jon's advantages, she's the one with the plan for the future (break the wheel). Jon cares about nothing beyond the war against the Night King. It's a comparison of their pre-series backstories. Cersei insists on sitting at the table. Jon knows what it is like to not have a seat at the table. Daenerys knows what it is like for there to not be a table at all.

It's also worth noting that Dany leads from the front line as well- admittedly, from the back of a dragon. She, too, is selfless, brave, bold, and just. Jon led a horrible plan that got one of her most powerful military assets, and children, killed, and despite ample amount of blame possible, she just says ""I am sad, but not sorry it happened. I needed to understand what really mattered."""
8033,gameofthrones,"So I’m right in the middle of my rewatch and I just finished season 4, and in S4E10 Cersei is arguing with Tywin about having to marry Loras Tyrell. She straight up tells Tywin that the rumors about her and Jamie are true, and tells him his whole legacy is a lie. What really stood out though is she says to him “If you took one look at your children in the past 20 years you would have seen it”. It goes to show that Tywin doesn’t care about his actual family members, he just cares about the reputation of the name Lannister. "

8070,gameofthrones,wow bran actually doesn’t look creepy as fuck
8071,gameofthrones,it was so casual and suddent hat the dramatic effect was even more intense than if they had drawn that scene out for dramatic effect. this episode was literally perfect in my eyes.
8072,gameofthrones,"Winterfells crypts were built by Bran the Builder. Same guy who built the wall. The wall fell pretty fast, but maybe there is something special."
8073,gameofthrones,I think the schedules of the actors is also a consideration; Turner has a X-Men movie coming up and others have several projects.
8074,gameofthrones,Daario + Drogon = Tywin??
8075,gameofthrones,"""This is Daenerys.  She's a product of generations of incest.  She fucked her nephew.  Incest is good.""

Edit:  seriously, is this a fucking joke?"
8076,gameofthrones," Both of those things simultaneously? Maybe not. But I think that Tyrion is probably smarter than Petyr, though he doesn't have the ambition. I think that C. Lannister is probably comparable in ambition, although she isn't as clever as Petyr. Regardless, he doesn't respect the intelligence or ambition of either of them. Or at least, it doesn't seem like he does. But who really knows what Littlefinger thinks most of the time? Not me. "
8077,gameofthrones,😐 you fucked ur aunt John

8080,gameofthrones,"Same here : +1 and I still laugh reading it

btw Hot Pie is obviously a faceless man bound to rightful vengeance : already killed king Jeoffrey and was involved in Walder Frey's demise.
It is known.

Might be a hidden Targ who was promised with royal feline ancestry tho. Seems legit."
8081,gameofthrones,"No the GRRM way will be Jorah being totally cured of greyscale  and free of danger, but the madness remains in his head and he turns crazy and gets so jealous of the blossoming relationship between Daenerys and Tyrion that he kills the latter. Valar morghulis."
8082,gameofthrones,They still have to sell the pilot to the networks for it to even be a show. If they thought it looked too squicky to sell - or of HBO flat out told them it was - then changing it was the better decision. They already had to sell incest and attempted child murder in that opening episode to begin with. 
8083,gameofthrones,"Camus and Balzac aren't well known outside literary circles. 

Also, I'd argue that Grisham is not that great if a writer. His books are good don't get me wrong but I wouldn't consider him great. "

8087,gameofthrones,"He just sees the trailers for the next episodes, same as us"
8088,gameofthrones,"Truth be told, Baelish was correct in a way. Ned's generation as well as Robb were the last of the traditional Stark ways of doing things. They weren't too cunning and they were too trusting (especially Robb after breaking his pact with Walder Frey.

Sansa and Arya had to learn cunning and deceit through their life experiences, and Bran definitely had his viewpoints on the world changed through his experiences and his role in the grand scheme of things.

Jon Snow is the closest to retaining the Stark way of doing things, and even he has done things differently to ensure survival.

Baelish won the game against Ned because Ned didn't know how to play. Baelish lost the game against Ned's daughters because his children learned how to play. "
8089,gameofthrones,O fuck

8110,gameofthrones,Have seen the series several times! Patrick Stewart with hair = scary.
8111,gameofthrones,"If so, they better spend some time fleshing him out. We've seen him once, and he's got potential for sure but Joffery and Ramsay had a lot of time to let the audience really despise them and their deaths felt well earned.

Euron's definitely got that smug, brutality aura about him but some groundwork is needed so we care enough to hate him."
8112,gameofthrones,"It is really significant. Tyrion hates violence of any kind. Even against his enemies. I started paying closer attention after i heard that story on my 3rd rewatch. Every time killing people is mentioned you can tell he's visibly distraught.  And he doesn't care about their place in the social hierarchy either. Everyone and every life has value to him. Hence, the sympathy for something as low as cockroaches."

8127,gameofthrones,"I disagree. Sansa was never really close with her Arya. Arya fucking lost her wolf because Sansa loved the lannister's so much.  You could see it in Arya's and Sansa's first reunion. They weren't like Jon and Sansa, or fuck even Bran. They still don't get along because they think both is doing woman wrong."

8146,gameofthrones,"I didn't dislike how fast the characters were moving from A to B, I disliked how it felt rushed at times.

The pacing difference between the first half of the show and second is going to be just ridiculous. "
8221,gameofthrones,"Yeah she’s super charming IRL so it’s be great to see her in more roles where she gets to be that way onscreen. After GOT I hope she doesn’t get typecast in too many of these stoic serious roles like Daenerys, just because that’s what made her famous."

I was referring to a cheated-on wife having to imagine that the woman her husband cheated with must have been gorgeous. Even the most beautiful woman in the world would hate that, and it's a shitty thing to have to think about every time you look at a child growing up in your own home. As well as the fact that he looked more Stark than her sons.

I still think, of course, that she was unnecessarily shitty to him, but I think it's important to at least try to undertand things you might not agree with.

People blaming Sansa for finally playing the game and not being superkind and sympathetic anymore after seasons of complaining about her being too passive and just letting things happen? So ridiculous.

And Jon acting on emotion like that isn't a completely understandable reaction after having lost so many *including* his own life? Add to that the fact that, Sansa was right, he *didn't* understand Ramsay, and even with Sansa's information he wouldn't be able to fully understand the lengths to which he would go because the dude's a psycho.

They both acted pretty much according to their past experiences and character. There's no reason to pick sides or feel the need to suddenly hate one while loving the other. *They are on the same side. They won*. We haven't even seen the two confront each other yet. Stop being so goddamn impatient."

8316,gameofthrones,"I don't really buy the whole indebted to LF part. LF would do anything for her in the hopes of something she does not have to give him. So far he just seems to be moping around Winterfell hoping for some attention, which is why he trails after her. Tries to get close to Bran in hopes of getting closer to Sansa through him or thinking he will be the new lord of Winterfell. Quickly realises that this ia the wrong tree to bark up. 

Only issue with all this is when LF gets sick of being spurned, he has proven how ruthless he can be which is where I think Sansa will show herself by dispatching LF in some manner.

Is Sansa an amazing strategist or player of the 'game'? I think that remains to be seen but she has displayed cunning in using people. Though I'm also of the opinion that Arya is an overrated character and I'm just waiting for when Jon finds out he is part Targaryen. Bran, well, he a motherfucking robot."

It's Cersei and Olenna btw."
8381,gameofthrones," I can totally see this happening. Jaime wanting to be with Brienne (or protect her even) and Tormund just dying to stick it to her.

8391,gameofthrones,"Ah yes, Winter finally arrives...this Spring."
8392,gameofthrones,"That fight was so well-written in the book.  You get a very good early feel for Bronn's character as he sizes up his opponent wearing the heavy armor, and considers his own light leather choice.  Fuck honor and ceremony - you do what it takes to win the fight."
8393,gameofthrones,This is simply amazing. I love it so much. I'm pretty sure over /r/MapPorn will enjoyed it too.
8394,gameofthrones,Just ask Jorah
8395,gameofthrones,"> Sansa told Jon to wait before attacking, so if he had listened to her, he would have learned the reinforcements were coming when they, you know, arrived.

In which case Ramsey would never have come out to meet them in the first place. He was only lured out by the prospect of a one-sided slaughter in his favor. The Vale Knights could have arrived hours or days later than they did; Sansa didn't know when or even if they were coming.

> Every person I reply to is bending over backwards to make Sansa out to be some genius, level headed tactician. She isn't. She screwed up big time and almost got Jon killed.

Not really. More like Jon is a shit commander who was easily manipulated into abandoning his own plan, even after being repeatedly warned by Sansa. Jon almost got Jon killed, along with his men, and people are bending over backwards to pin his colossal failures on Sansa, because she (rightfully) decided not to trust him with sensitive information.

> Things worked out in spite of her, not because of her. She didn't plan any of that. It was luck.

She planned to bring the Vale army, and advised Jon to wait. Jon refused, because he foolishly believed he could save Rickon, whereas Sansa knew he was dead the moment Smalljon Umber handed him over to Ramsey. "

Jo told him it was fine, all that really mattered is that he had the same eye color as Lily.  

Of course, years later we get Lily and she’s got Brown eyes.

But whatever.  "
8470,gameofthrones,"There's still time for something twisty to happen. Perhaps, one or both of them make it worse or can't do anything and it turns out the ones who really save things are the Brotherhood Without Banners - it then turns our ""heroes"" into the accidental ""villains"" of the story. That would have some heavy implications on the message and drives the whole ""a good man doesn't make a good king and vice versa"" *kind* of logic. Then, the themes of ignorance, human imperfection, and higher powers (god(s) plan(s)) take stage front and center - the story becomes more Abrahamic. Then, the point of view would become a HUGE talking point as well when analyzing the series. 

Or, it could turn out that the White Walkers have a *good* (or bad) reason to be upset and that, surprisingly, they end up bringing winter and killing most everybody and set up a puppet government. Perhaps, it even implies that humanity is better off that way and maybe it *is*. That would also make the story more Abrahamic because the ""Great Other""/Night King is also a god in the story. Only, in this iteration, the *fear* of God plays a bigger thematic role than it already does. The themes of ignorance and human imperfection still play a role, but now so does the human perspective on morality - questions like ""how do you know what is good and bad?"" and ""on what basis/authority are your judgments on what is good vs. bad and do they mean anything?"" come into a more prominent role. Not to mention the whole questioning of the afterlife that would happen. The dead become wights - slaves to the White Walkers; unable to stray. In Abrahamic religions, the dead either become angels (or something like it) or are resurrected into a paradise - either way, they're unable to sin. It's an easy parallel and metaphor. 

I could probably think of more ways for it to end and the groundwork will still be there.  "

Escaping is one thing, but everything is facilitated by Littlefinger working in the background to push her forward, and even he *allows* the Boltons to use her. She didn't win the battle of the bastards by herself, but once she gets revenge on Ramsay she really only cuts off the strings when she starts making the decisions for herself and takes Littlefinger out of the picture, permanently.

In her own words - she is a slow learner, but she did learn."

Using the phrase ""Down Boy/girl"" is in reference to dogs. When a dog acts up in an unwanted manner, you use that phrase to calm him. In this case Dany's nether regions = the ""dog"" acting up in the unwanted manner.  "

8641,gameofthrones,"> Pause the video a lot and note what is on the paper when it slips under the paper her hand is resting on, then note what it looks like when it comes back out from the paper. Magic!
> 
> Edit: Watch back of his head specifically. POOF! Full shading and detail instantly, without doing any actual drawing! MAGIC! lol. Can't believe you guys are falling for this.

I have gone through the video frame by frame and my conclusion is you're just full of shit, if you'll excuse my saying so. If you're talking about these [two shots](https://imgur.com/a/1BBQp), they're from different sessions (note the change in lighting and clutter). 

The first shot was taken first, she then continue drawing some off-camera due to forgetting to turn it on, can't be bothered to take a photo every 10 seconds due to her intervalometer breaking, went  outside under a tree somewhere, not wanting to pad the video with boring shading work or the other 1001 possible reasons why this perfectly normal timeskip would happen. And then she went into another session - this time on camera - continue drawing and the second shot happens.  

In other words, it's just a normal casual timelapse like others.  

I also find the person being an actual artist more likely than her being a conman that goes through all the troubles of setting up a fake working studio, with all the fake stationary and then fabricate a creation video frame by frame.  "

8677,gameofthrones,[It sure has.](https://cloudsfactory.net/game-of-thrones-houses-banners.html) 
8678,gameofthrones,"What was wrong with how Arya found out about Jon?  
She was in a tavern, one that is famous for how many important roads connect to it.  
It's the perfect place to hear about what's going on in Westeros and it makes perfect sense for Arya to visit it on her way South from the Twins.  

And how are they supposed to ""show not tell"" Arya finding out about Jon? That doesn't make any sense.  
They did ""show not tell"" her decision to turn around and go North, which was a great moment IMO.  

And the battle scene was very good IMO, the choreography was great and the editing was fine.  
Jump cuts and fast paced editing have always existed in GOT fight scenes, except for a few of the Jon Snow fights.  
I don't think that they were badly executed, it was still fairly easy to see what was going on, if anything I think that the darkness was a problem more so than the editing.  

I thought that the dialogue was actually very good, especially the Dany/Varys scene at the beginning, but the rest was good as well.

8759,gameofthrones,"I read GRRM for the first time after reading through Wheel of Time (once by reading, and once with my wife listening to audible, so a long block of time) and before the show came out. I felt so violated at some of GRRM's plot twists, but in a way that I couldn't stop from reading them voraciously. After years of reading Mary Sue/Gary Stu type characters that never seem to die, I almost puked at Ned's beheading. What kind of author kills off the hero?!

So, I think to myself, oh, right, he has a son and there are chapters that revolve around him, he must be the hero that I should get emotionally attached to. Oh great, he's dead, too. 

I really credit GRRM for making me a cynical bastard. Well, GRRM and the crippling debt of school loans. "

Firstly, what the fuck does 'you guys' here even mean?

And secondly, do yourself a favour and find any passage that even hints at this 'foreshadowing'. Contrary to what you claim, Stannis explicitly instructs his knights that if he dies, their duty is to put Shireen on the Iron Throne. She isn't even at Winterfell for him to burn and is hundreds of miles away at Castle Black. Read the bloody books first before boasting about having 'an accurate read' of the character."

8795,gameofthrones,"I think Littlefinger's storyline was screwed up pretty badly by the TV writers, but will make more sense in the books if they're ever finished.

Littlefinger causes all this chaos so he can find opportunities to gain power, and after years of this he has finally decided to stick with one plan - make Sansa as powerful as possible, make Sansa trust him as much as possible, then marry her. He gets everything he wants.

In the show he tried to position her as the Queen in the North and was disappointed when the people wanted Jon. No doubt he was planning to eliminate Jon when he gets chance. But it would be a big problem for him if Sansa realizes there's someone else she can trust as much as Littlefinger. Bran is zoned out and apathetic, so he's not a threat... but Arya will be, so she needs to go. He wants to be the only person Sansa has trust in.

I suspect the storyline to get Sansa to distrust Arya will make more sense in the books than the rushed nonsense that happened in the show.

The whole problem with the TV storyline is that Sansa's trust in Littlefinger completely fell apart when he convinced her to marry Ramsey. There's absolutely no reason for Littlefinger to do this and it screws up his plans.... and it doesn't happen in the books.

Sansa only married Ramsay in the show because the writers had to eliminate as many extra characters as possible to condense the story. In the books, Ramsay marries a childhood friend of Sansa and Theon. This probably should have been left out of the show, but that would leave Theon without a reason to betray Ramsay and jump off of the walls of Winterfell with.

Instead of creating a new reason for Theon's story to continue, they pushed Sansa into that role even though it makes no sense for Littlefinger and Sansa's storyline, and probably convinced themselves it's OK because it makes Ramsey seem even more evil and will make his death even sweeter to see. That's true, but it wasn't worth it.

For the story to work correctly, the viewer should be convinced that Sansa completely trusts Littlefinger and sees him as a mentor. Sansa realizes she has a lot to learn from someone like him, Sansa realizes his judgment is better than hers, and she's happy that he's acquiring power for her and keeping her safe. 

Then it should be a huge surprise when she turns on him and leaves him behind. And I suppose the show didn't totally fail here because of they way the scene was filmed, it did come off as surprising. But if you stop and think about it for a second you'd realize after the stuff with Ramsey she'd have little trust left in him and would question all of his motives and realize she needs to get rid of him.

Also, it's just dumb of the show to have Littlefinger have no idea what kind of a person Ramsey is. Littlefinger knows everyone, he knows everyone's motives and can predict their actions... how would he have this huge blind spot for Ramsey? And after things going so badly for Sansa... how would he be caught off guard by her lacking trust in him?

The show was still entertaining... but this storyline was definitely botched to some extent."

8805,gameofthrones,"I would imagine Bronn has heard word that Tyrion is working for Dany.  I don't think he or Jaime knows that Tyrion was watching that battle, but I think Tyrion will be there when Dany takes them prisoner.  And I agree that he'll try to talk her out of killing Jaime and Bronn.

There is the question of how she'll react to that, though.  She might question Tyrion's loyalty.  After all, Bronn's some random nobody fighting for the enemy as far as she's concerned, and Jaime is the guy who stabbed her father in the back when he was sworn to protect her.  For the most part, she'd rather people bend the knee than die, but if there's one person who she really wants to just kill, it's probably Jaime.

Convincing her to hear Jaime's side of the story and not condemn him for it will be one hell of a task."

8808,gameofthrones,"She said hey Jon can we get married at the stone, I said bitch you need to sail before you bawl. Come and meet me in your quarters Dan and show me why you deserve to have the wolf."
8809,gameofthrones,"Another theory is that the hair of Cersei and Jaime has darkened as they have suffered throughout the show. They are older and wiser, though Cersei has grown in wickedness and her hair color has become dull yellow, like gold if it tarnished, and Jaime has grown bitter as he slowly realizes the evil he has done and how far he has fallen from his ideals. Even his grizzled face speaks to bitterness. 

I know one of the characteristics of Tyrion that suggests that maybe he is a secret Targaryen is that the blonde in his hair is almost white. But I think in the show with a darkened he's here to make sure that Dany's hair continues to stand out.

I also think that the silvery white of Targaryen hair is something more easily described in GRRM's prose than depicted on a screen without a lot of expensive CGI. The camera is much better at capturing the nuance between dark blonde hair and legitimate brown hair. Both facts may explain the darkening of Lannister hair over the past seven years of the show. "

8840,gameofthrones,"This, exactly. I haven't seen anyone else mention the fact that they are now married and consummating the marriage. I find it hard to believe Sansa could be the only young newlywed of that time period to not be hyped to have sex with her husband--who is still a complete stranger in this situation--on their wedding night, but what did she expect would happen? With Tyrion she was treated gently and wasn't pressured to have sex at all. Sure this situation with Ramsey is rape, but I don't think the concept of rape within a marriage even existed back then, so it's not as unthinkable as these critics are making it out to be. There have been worse examples of rape in the show before now."

We thought it would be fun to relive those moments through others and how off base some of the thoughts we had at those times were of our own. Getting that film of the ""where is this going"" along with the reactions of when It inevitably does not go that way (As posted here)... That would be the basis of the show."

9002,gameofthrones,"Yeah I try to avoid criticizing Martin's decisions because the unpredictability gives the story such an organic feel, but I do think this was a mistake.    


The reason I say this is because I think it's still totally plausible that, if exonerated by Trial by Combat, Tyrion would still have said fuck this shit and left King's Landing, so the Tyrion-Danerys plotline would remain more or less intact.  


And it would have solved this problem of the King's Landing plot post-Tyrion having a character we actually root for, and driving the narrative forward.  I thought it was a real low point in the show, watching Cersei wrestle with the High Sparrow and the Tyrell's and not really even being sure who i should root for or whether I even care who gets the upper hand.  


It would have changed the King's Landing plot drastically of course, and that's assuming Oberyn wouldn't have just gone back to Dorne.  But I think there was much greater potential with Oberyn than without."

The show doesn't actually specify or indicate that first WW created by Leaf is the Night King.  Conversely, there is no Night King, as in a WW/Others leader, in the books (as of yet, perhaps there will be in the ~~Wonds of Winter~~ Winds of Wonter)."

9064,gameofthrones,"> Wouldn't a sentient being with limited/short life be the only one who could make a moral decision? Actions only have the meaning they do because of the short time we're given.

No, because limited time to make decisions means that potentially we cannot make the best decisions possible. We are limited by the small understanding we have. We are limited by our meagre experiences. We don't know truly what the best moral decisions are sometimes, because there is not time enough to understand the implications of everything we do. 

Furthermore, a god would be able to understand our perspective too. Which means a god can also appreciate the time-sensitive context of certain decisions and their moral impact. 

> There's a reason bad guys in movies always refer to the 'greater good' to justify actions.

Agreed, but these bad guys are not gods, and so their understanding of the 'greater good' is limited too. They simply think they're doing what's best, just as Melisandre did. She found out she hadn't taken everything into consideration, which is precisely something only a god can do. "

As someone who has both PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome (Theon/Reek has both), they've done an excellent job with his character development.  I knew he wasn't better, I could still see the damage in him over the last couple of seasons.  It's not something that can be cured, just learned to cope with and mental illness is very poorly understood in Westros.  Flashbacks like he has are very real and a situation like that can easily revert him to Reek again.  Reek is just out for survival and doing what needs to happen in order to survive.  Stockholm, when you boil it down, is essentially a survival mechanism.  The two diagnosis alone (thank God he's not schizophrenic) can be crippling.  He really doesn't need to see battle again."

9139,gameofthrones,"It's a never ending cycle of show hate in there nowadays. No matter what happens there is no pleasing them its all ""shitty writing and teleportation"".  Every last goddamn thing has been theorized to death so now matter what happens people are pissed because it either didn't meet these grand expectations they've been building in their heads for years  or panned out completely different than they expected. Not to mention a general lack of understanding that what works in a book will not always work in a show.

Personally I think the show adaption has been stellar in nearly every regard especially considering the scale of difficulty of this series, I mean shit if the guy writing the story cant even untangle the mess of characters and plot points hes written I cant even imagine adapting it into a T.V show.  However the shows popularity and quality are a testament not only to GRRM's universe which we all love so much but to the army of people working so hard on it as well."

9156,gameofthrones,"I'd say he is very much wrong, as one of the main purposes of that speech is to highlight the folly in his mentality. 

He is close in that how you do it doesn't matter, but the goal isn't just to kill it is to survive. History is truly written by the *survivors*. In that sense it DOES matter how you kill your enemies, since that might determine whether or not someone comes for vengence.

In the case of Frey, he believed that he was above the Starks since he was willing to cross any line to remove them as enemies. Had he fought honorably, he would have survived. So the moral is that in the end, yes, you should do whatever it takes to survive, but that doesn't mean you can be dishonorable and traitorous as you want, since in the long term you may be damning yourself just as surely. 

That is what Jon learned when he died on the watch. Being too honorable means you don't survive and none of it matters anyway, such as was the case of Ned. Be too dishonorable, and you lose support and the protection of mutual respect that keeps rules safe. "

9281,gameofthrones,">doesn't need to bring dragons north of the wall, night king is still stuck.

The whole reason Jon had to go North of the wall was because the night's watch was so understaffed they were going to be overwhelmed. Guaranteed. In the mean time the war would still be raging and the armies that have already lost significant numbers would be in even worse shape to repel the invasion. The wall was never in play: either the dragon destroys it or the Watch gets slaughtered because they were few in number and poorly supplied.

The dead have infinite patience and don't tire, left alone one undead with an ice pick would eventually tunnel through the wall if need be. And the Night King has a hell of a lot more than one. The Dragon made it easier but it also stopped the war and Jon finally got people to take the undead threat seriously.

The alternative version of events isn't ""the Night King is stuck"", it's: he slaughters the watch then descends on already decimated armies still at war with each other and slaughters them in the confusion. And probably still picks up an undead dragon or two in the process."
9282,gameofthrones,"> It would have to be a recessive trait in order to mean anything.

Blonde hair is the recessive trait. For blonde hair to suddenly appear in three children of a family marked by a dominant gene would be incredibly unlikely. A recessive gene maintaining dominance in a family line would require selective (in)breeding."

9304,gameofthrones,"The argument about how the Walkers got the iron chains is a prime example of how nit picky people have become. Were the Wildlings using wooden swords at the battle of Castle Black? Iron forging isn't a mystical technology like it was back when the Andals arrived in Westeros. What makes it so difficult that the Night King would have access to some iron chains? 

Also heard that Viserion's death was lame. You know, how the Night King speared him with a magic ice spear causing Viserion to cry in pain while his blood rained from the sky and his chest burning up as he fell. Sure. Exactly what I would call a lame death.

Don't get me started on the teleportation that puts the entire show in jeopardy. Like the show hadn't been doing that for seasons now. The only time the characters don't teleport is when there's charcter development in the journey, not the destination. That way the characters take an entire season to move the distance someone could do in a single scene. The travel time has always been inconsistent. "

9317,gameofthrones,That look between Arya and Littlefinger. Arya was Tywin's cupbearer at Harrenhal and she saw first hand of Littlefinger and Tywin scheming together. He might have realized that Tywin's cupbearer was actually Arya (if he didn't know already). Littlefinger also realized where Arya has been. House Baelish was founded by a man from Braavos. Littlefinger has a connection to Braavos and most likely knows a lot about it. He saw Arya water dancing against Brienne and water dancing is the unique style of sword fighting mostly associated with the city of Braavos. He probably realized just how dangerous Arya can be now and where she was this whole time.

Not true for nude scenes. They still have to shoot the scene with the actor they just also have to shoot the scene with the body double and then edit it in a convincing way.

9414,gameofthrones,"Thats how shit was in times like that. When a girl is ""flowered"" she was ripe for marriage, yeah it sucks but thats how it was. Yeah she was scared, most women who are in arranged marriages are scared but she made the best of a shit situation. Before she was married off to Drogo, she was her brothers pawn to be beaten and abused whenever she breathed wrong, fuck even afterwards, he still treated her like she belonged to him. Being with Drogo and the Dothraki gave her the strength and the confidence to stand up for herself and fight back against Viserys and his abuse. 

Yes, admittedly the sex was rough on her in the beginning until she took control and made him do it her way. I believe that was when they fully fell for eachother because that was the first time they were able to connect on not just a physical level but on an emotional level as well. Drogo treated her like his Queen and she treated him like her King. 

Most Khals treat their wives as property or just around for breeding purposes and as we saw in season 6, have more than one."

The fire consumes the lion so I’m assuming early on we see Danny take down the Lannister’s or maybe somehow they join forces? 

Then the real battle begins at what looks like the Twins which I guess would make sense to make a stand there from a military perspective.

But I really wasn't a fan of the Dragonstone scenes. There was some wonky camera stuff going on between Jon and Missandei for some reason, and I'm REALLY unhappy with the use of cave paintings as a narrative tool. It seems like such a cop-out for a series that would usually otherwise use clever thought to fix the problem. Now Dany believes Jon completely and the idea that cave paintings was the solution to their mental disconnections makes me wild. I suppose I'm only nitpicking though. Personally I wouldn't give this episode anything over an 8, and that's only pulled up from a low 7 due to the battle towards the end."

9527,gameofthrones,"This is a lightweight stand-in for costume, it should have been edited around for this scene. When there is a real steel sword in his hands, it's going to be like a real one, dull but essentially the same. In film, TV and Theater, there are usually different versions of props, depending on their intended use. "
9528,gameofthrones,"At least Rhaegal and Drogon got the better end hanging out with their mother's broody boyfriend. 

"
9529,gameofthrones,"Some good points. Personally, it never felt like dozens of problems were cropping up when one was solved. Actually, I was always a bit frustrated by the lack of long lasting consequences from obviously horrible choices. But I also only watched the show so maybe that’s more well done in the books. You could argue that it isn’t textbook but it does have a lot of characteristics of a white savior narrative "
9530,gameofthrones,Babyface Bambino? The gangster? 
9531,gameofthrones,Top of his class though.

9534,gameofthrones,"It's like a joke, sans a joke."
9535,gameofthrones,"I'll wait indefinitely, it's not like it takes effort. If TWOW doesn't get released, whatever. It was the best series of books I've ever read despite not being finished. If it does get released, then that's fantastic, time to start the indefinite wait for ASOS."
9536,gameofthrones,She was passable as Sarah Connor in terminator: genisys

9540,gameofthrones,"Wouldn't say it has to be man with ex-gf; my intention was to leave it open (person and ex-SO). I don't think there's a consensus on what happens more, but that people like to think there is a consensus."
9541,gameofthrones,"Yes I understand this, I was just saying that the editing makes the timing feel strange."
9542,gameofthrones,She shows it sometimes like when she's freed the slaves. Although I'd say her smiling more often like this would be completely wrong for the character. It'd be annoying. 
9543,gameofthrones,"the entire sequence leading up to cersei blowing up the sept.  the pacing, the music, everything is perfection.

close followup is watching the dragons destroy the lannister army."
9544,gameofthrones,Doot doot
9545,gameofthrones,I’m not up to the point where she works in a WWII military factory...so definitely a spoiler.

9556,gameofthrones,I must have watched that scene a half a hundred times by now.
9557,gameofthrones,"It's not true. A wolf that was adopted by GRRM had passed away at a wolf sanctuary. But it wasnt the same animal.

Edit: dont downvote me because I'm clarifying misinformation that's been spread since last year lol"

9571,gameofthrones,I thought Horn Hill was depicted above and beyond what it should have been. I don't have a suggestion though - my castle game is weak.

9573,gameofthrones,"Just read it again with a Jamaican accent, it'll solve the anxiety."

9578,gameofthrones,"Yeah, but you never cash out. The following week you just take another for sure bet. It's Game of Thrones, main characters never die, easy money!"
9579,gameofthrones,Wowza! You nailed this! Great facial expressions. 
9580,gameofthrones,This is so cool. 
9581,gameofthrones,Fuck Kiera
9582,gameofthrones,"I wish the booths had been a lower price. $700 for the 10x10 is higher than any locally powered conventions charge in the area. No matter the event, it is uncertain if that booth fee money comes back in sales. "

9586,gameofthrones,"Lemme just quote Varys here real quick.  ""Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.""   Just because you like something doesn't mean it's free from criticism.  In fact, it proves how strong GoT's pull is because no matter how many flaws we can see and point out, we keep coming back.  It's the same with anything, you can't ignore the problems just because you like something."
9587,gameofthrones,He'll stick you with something...
9588,gameofthrones,"I'm not usually a Jaime fangirl, but that smile.."
9589,gameofthrones,"As different as two shows deriving much of their plot from incest, arson and amputated body parts can be."

9594,gameofthrones,"This obviously is by no means necessarily applicable in this situation, but i was an extra in Harry Potter, and the general rules were if you had more than 2 lines of dialogue, your pay roughly tripled. If you had a character name, no matter how minor 'Boy in cloak', 'Loud goblin' etc- you got considerably more. So i had a friend who had some sort of vague 'oh look, it's harry, he's back!!' etc kind of thing, and his pay tripled.

obviously i'm sure this is totally different to GoT but interesting nonetheless"
9595,gameofthrones,"Hey, good on you. It takes a bit to get going but once it hooks you you're done. I heard nothing but amazing praise for the show and it still exceeded my expectations. Enjoy!"
9596,gameofthrones,Yup
9597,gameofthrones,"I think the point is that there are more dead Starks than dead Boltons. The numbers vary based on show vs. books, and whether you want to count extended family/loyal household members, etc, but most of the ways you look at it, the Starks win, if being more dead counts as a win."
9598,gameofthrones,You'd think they could afford to put her in a bra that fits.

9601,gameofthrones,Lucio is where it's at.
9602,gameofthrones,"By finding out after you watched it that scenes with him used a CGI double that you didn't notice during first viewing? Then the following sentence makes perfect sense:

>people admired the CG Paul Walker in FF7 for being so realistic and well made that they didn't even notice it's actually CGI.

makes perfect sense.

Which is the exact point they were making: When it is done well, you don't notice. When it isn't done well, you complain about it being CGI and looking unreal in some fashion."
9603,gameofthrones,Nope just lucky. 
9604,gameofthrones,"I like your smile! Sometimes I ask myself why you need to go around flaunting yourself when you could have a nice guy like me? I would respect you and treat you well.  Anyway, I have some important, intelligent activities to attend to. Now I must bid you adeiu.


Edit: you’re not even going to reply to me, OP?  Don't ignore me you rancid swine. It wouldn't have worked out anyway as you would have gotten lost in the labyrinth that is my mind. Typical thot trying to get attention yet ignores me when I’m just being nice. BTW I can see your panty line above your knee, it’s a bit of a turnoff to a classy guy like me as it basically proclaims to the world ""I like to have unprotected sex with lots of guys!"" . And that scab on your index finger is probably from all the STD’s you get. I didn’t even really like you that much anyway. Sigh...if only opening up to women was as easy as the opening moves in a chess game...I wouldn't expect most women to understand the burden of high IQ in this twisted society, but life goes on, doesn't it?"
9605,gameofthrones,Cover is white. Cause you know... uh winter. 
9606,gameofthrones,The Valyrians definitely seem to be Roman-esque while the Ghiscari seem to be analog to the Persian Empires. There's even civilizations clearly inspired by Chinese dynasties in the World of Ice and Fire book 
9607,gameofthrones,That watermark - Spic Jointer??? a Hispanic marijuana roller?
9608,gameofthrones,Has anyone said they will eat a shoe or some shit if she lives through the season?
9609,gameofthrones,"she did lay down in that nice woman's house for like, an hour.

obviously she would have been fully healed."
9610,gameofthrones,"True.

Well, we're screwed"
9611,gameofthrones,It's a chorus of glorious cunts.

9616,gameofthrones,"King me, dear."
9617,gameofthrones,"ASOIAF is what happens after the fantasy series comes to an end. 

It begins with a princess held in a tower by a dragon. He writes about the attempt to return to normality *after* the ""heroes"" won the war. "

9619,gameofthrones,"Okay, yeah, totally thought you were trying to cosplay the ancient one and that other evil dude. It's a nice cosplay! A bell would've been a bitching addition :D"
9620,gameofthrones,"Like ridiculously fast, nicely done OP. "
9621,gameofthrones,All men must clap.
9622,gameofthrones,Fair enough. But he's Bernard. He was awesome. I don't lump him in with the others.
9623,gameofthrones,Are you talking about the fire resistant hairs?
9624,gameofthrones,probably the mountain.
9625,gameofthrones,...and then were disappointed after clicking.
9626,gameofthrones,Wtf I though Peter Dinklage did a photo shoot as Tyrion. Major props to you 
9627,gameofthrones,Mourning Wood.
9628,gameofthrones,But he remembered Aegon V.
9629,gameofthrones,"Color changing led...it also looks awesome as it cycles to red, green, yellow, etc!"
9630,gameofthrones,"Yes, true. I saw your comment about the dragon escaping above. Same could be said about the old kings of the north with the gang taking the iron swords. There is also the theme of Bran emerging with his skin changing abilities strengthened after being in the dark so long, just like Arya as the blind girl becomes a better faceless man. Bran's last paragraph in the last chapter of Clash is about the weirwood tree and the roots being more than the stone walls of winterfell. It'd be kind of cheap to end the book with another dragon birth. "
9631,gameofthrones,Then Olly shouldn't have Jon on his list. We don't actually know who planned the mutiny but it probably wasn't Olly. Most likely Thorne.
9632,gameofthrones,And a Littlefinger in a pear tree!
9633,gameofthrones,"good point

but why wasn't ghost with him for the 2nd ranging north of the wall?"
9634,gameofthrones,Brienne with the sassiest of comebacks though

9637,gameofthrones,"Hate the character, love the actress 😍"
9638,gameofthrones,No
9639,gameofthrones,"I have to echo what the user above you said. I was looking at the second picture thinking that was the cosplay you posted. When I realized that was actually Sophie, I went back to the top pic and realized that was actually it.

Not only did you match the aesthetics, the location was perfect as well. Kudos to you and your photographer."
9640,gameofthrones,and Moon Boy for all we know.
9641,gameofthrones,ohh hahaha!  I whooshed there :)
9642,gameofthrones,Dani has a Hitler stache
9643,gameofthrones,Queen/Mother of Dragons 😍
9644,gameofthrones,"Cersei ""just blow up all my problems"" Lannister. "
9645,gameofthrones,"This is just an obtuse interpretation of her character arc. She was very obviously telling the Lannisters exactly what they wanted to hear from her. Tyrion even comments on it at one point, and says she’s smart.      

She genuinely didn’t have any power at that point in time, so she was harmless in a way. Under those circumstances of intense phycological torture and danger, just staying alive was an achievement. "
9646,gameofthrones,"This practically jumps off the page, super well done. "
9647,gameofthrones,At the end of the day regardless of what the last straw was. The mad king was a ticking time bomb and i'm sure people would have rose up eventually anyways. The mad king would have inevitably burned the shit out of some important people. 
9648,gameofthrones,"I think Sansa being taller fits tho, at the beginning she hadn’t even gone thru puberty yet so once those hormones hit she shot up"
9649,gameofthrones,Bingo. 
9650,gameofthrones,"Actually, he only trained Jaime because in the books Jaime and Illyn Payne had a bromance but the actor who played Payne got cancer so they gave all his scenes to Bronn."
9651,gameofthrones,who names a dragon drogon lmao
9652,gameofthrones,BATMN
9653,gameofthrones,Someone make a mobile app out of this
9654,gameofthrones,I think you mean looks perfect
9655,gameofthrones,"People are taking him at face value which is what makes most sense. That's what Ned and Lysa did and they're both fine.

I think it's reasonable to say that he's made stupid choices because he wants Sansa, but assuming that he doesn't have contingencies and schemes working at all times is absurd. 

I mean, he literally had Sansa under his thumb when he decided to give her to the Boltons. This entire thing was basically orchestrated by him. "
9656,gameofthrones,So if we kill blue eyes wight drogon a bunch of walkers die as well?
9657,gameofthrones,"*Yer

Man it's like no one on the internet can get Your/You're/Yer right"

9665,gameofthrones,"Yeah, it's the ""shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand"" event - war was going to happen, it just needed the spark to get started"
9666,gameofthrones,I want Khal Drogo back in the series :((
9667,gameofthrones,The Targaryens did wear a lot of purples and golds in the past. I hope Dany goes back to more colorful clothes. I loved her in blue.

9672,gameofthrones," With those last few episodes of Breaking Bad especially, there was not a single scene that didn't captivate and awe me. I felt that this episode definitely had that same vibe to it. Each scene was stunning"
9673,gameofthrones,The number of episodes doesn't matter for time in the show.  The scenes are not sequential.
9674,gameofthrones,"*Brienne kills a Giant 

Arya: “That still only counts as one!”"

9676,gameofthrones,"Thanks for the approval, and thanks for not being Sappy about it. "
9677,gameofthrones,yeah the bran out the window thing is just unforgivable for me. i can't look past that.
9678,gameofthrones,"I just finished rewatching all the seasons last night, now I just need to sleep for a month to make time go faster"
9679,gameofthrones,About. Damn. Time.
9680,gameofthrones,"I think we have different interpretations of ""family"".  
Cersei certainly wants the Lannister Name to be the one everyone knows and fears, she wants that legacy, but it's dead, though she fights anyway. Prophecy of three children, the fourth won't see the light of day for whatever reason. She wants the legacy and name, but she doesn't care for the people. She actively hates Tyrion. She wants to marry Jaime (more or less), and she wants her father's approval which she never got and never will now.
Jaime only wanted to make his sister happy. Shallow, but then so was he. He's grown though, and now realizes his mistakes. He may eventually show us he's redeemed himself and become more than a ""summer knight"", but he's not been much more than a pawn in other's games. He's the least like Tywin I agree, but he has potential. Probably going to be cut short now though. Time's up.  
Tyrion drinks and whores because that's all that's expected of him. He does what his father asks and gets slapped around for doing it well. He'll never be good enough for his father, or the Seven Realms, so he doesn't bother, unless there's a need. Be Hand, he's a good Hand. Be treasurer, well he was not as good as Littlefinger but Littlefinger was playing them all. Be advisor to Dany, he's good at it. Rule Mereen, ok, done. He knows no matter what he does, he won't get acknowledgement any more than Cersei did. He's an embarrassment and a reminder of what Tywin lost. 

So all told, Tywin was screwed. Cersei wasn't smart enough, Jaime not mature enough, and Tyrion wouldn't be allowed to be the man needed to keep the line alive. His only legacy could have been the ""Baratheon"" Kings, and those were poisoned or killed themselves.  
Given his backstory I do feel bad for him somewhat, then I hear ""The Rains of Castamere"" and recall what he did to Tyrion's wife. He got no more than he deserved."
9681,gameofthrones,"I thought the Winterfell stuff in ADWD was incredible, easily my favourite part of the book."
9682,gameofthrones,"Honestly I was hoping for explodey wildfire grenade shenanigans. It would've been an interesting plotline, to see Cersei ~~""Baron of exlpodo-kills""~~ Lannister's increasing obsession with wildfire and using it in battle."
9683,gameofthrones,Wouldn't that mean that Cersei a Targaryen too? Unless this is some sort of Arrested Development situation. 
9684,gameofthrones,"I met a guy with this same costume at DragonCon. He told me about how the day before it was so hot his robe had become soggy with sweat. Thankfully he threw it in the *dryer* the night before. 

I’ve never smelled worse smelling people than at DragonCon. "
9685,gameofthrones,"I wasn't giving her a pass. I was saying that either way Rickard and Brandon would be pissed.

Lyanna was a child and all ready promised to another. Marriages in Westeros are political. She didn't have a say in the matter. 

Especially when Rhaegar was in his 20s, married and had children. You can play the argument she was a stupid kid in love but to a father all he would see is Rhaegar taking advantage, consensual or not.

They still would have showed up to KL and demanded an explanation and Aerys being insane would have burned them"

9691,gameofthrones,Hope there's not a blizzard in the forecast.
9692,gameofthrones,"At the end of the last episode, the final battle has just ended. All of our beloved characters are dead, or so we think. Out of the rubble crawls Bronn and Tyrion who look around and realize they're all that's left. Tyrion says something like ""I suppose it's up to us to rebuild"" and Bronn joins reluctantly. As they walk off into the sunset, Tyrion finally tells this joke in its entirety, and the two laugh as it cuts to the credits while [this song plays](https://youtu.be/ztZI2aLQ9Sw) and everyone feels bittersweet. The end."

9704,gameofthrones,"This is fucking hilarious! As a fellow spear chucker, I'm jealous."
9705,gameofthrones,Still no explanation if it's the rod and stones or just he stones...
9706,gameofthrones,The fuck is that!?!!
9707,gameofthrones,"Not to mention all their children. I'm not saying he made the right decision, but I'm sure better people than Jaime would at least consider it. ... although, a better person probably wouldn't have ended up in that position to begin with. "
9708,gameofthrones,"I remember hearing about an actor or actress who left Eastenders (a British soap opera) because the amount of shit s/he got on the street for their character overwhelmed them. I can’t remember who it was, but some people clearly have problems separating fiction from reality."
9709,gameofthrones,"My theory is that Sansa is gunna fuck up the north since Jon dipped, little finger is gunna fuck with Sansa, arya is gunna show up and save the day get little fingers and get little fingers face, then her and Sansa are gunna plot something and arya is gunna end up in a big meeting with Jon snow where she can't break character, and Jon will go into a blind rage after hearing what littlefinger did to Sansa in winterfell, stab arya pretending to be little finger with long claw and that's when his sword is going to burst into flames and Jon snow will become the prince that's promised"

9719,gameofthrones,"My friend's dad has bred wolf hybrids as long as I've known them. I honestly didn't believe my friend that they had any wolf in them until I saw them in person.

They're massive and intimidating as hell.

The one his dad has now as his own pet is super sweet with people he trusts. And luckily I've been around him a lot since he was a pup. So around me he's just a giant dog that's super skidish and really playful. I fuckin' love that wolf-dog. "

9729,gameofthrones,"Brandon went directly to KL after hearing about Lyanna's abduction, her was on his way to get married to Catelyn Tully but postponed it as soon as he heard about his sister. Yes he did say ""come out and die"" but at that point all he knew was that Rhaegar kidnapped his sister, he was challenging Rhaegar to a fight.

Aerys charged Brandon with plotting to murder the prince, and basically called Rickard to go bail his son out for being a dumb ass. Accounts differ, the whole point of the backstory is that it comes from different points of views to muddy up what actually happened, but the most neutral telling of the story is that Areys was still semi-sane when he arrested Brandon and at the time intended to be reasonable when Rickard arrived, but somewhere between demanding he come down and arresting Brandon something snapped and he got more crazy, prompting him to just kill both.

End of the day regardless of details, the Starks never would have went to Kings Landing if it wasnt for Lyanna, they wouldn't have burned, and Areys most likely wouldn't have called for Neds head. If Brandon just left the whole thing alone the series of events would have played out much differently."
9730,gameofthrones,"Ned told Arya that she looked liked Lyanna, who we all know to be very pretty. The Faceless men also think that Arya's well suited to train as a courtesan."

9748,gameofthrones,"I completely see your point. I do, I promise. I’m a student minister, and wrestle with this every year. I wonder what reddit thinks of the compromise I’ve landed at. 

We have yearly opportunities to do mission work inside our city, in a neighboring state, and internationally. We don’t go to a different place every year, it’s always to visit and help the same missionaries in Guatemala. We take a really small group, about 7 students. The reason I go through all the work and prep and stress of the trip is because there’s a chance that this trip helps a student realize they want to be a missionary. So it’s like paying it forward and raising up the next crop of missionaries. ...although there are inevitably those kids who want to go volintour, I try to weed that out. "

9760,gameofthrones,"Eh. He's really weird about fanfiction, so I don't know about that. But it's true, it's more like a retelling than fanfcition."
9761,gameofthrones,"I don't know why they chose not to burn his body. I just meant that you couldn't predict his resurrection based on that, after watching season 5, since it wasn't shown until season 6.

And I still don't understand why he had to die to get out of the watch. It doesn't make sense. From everyone elses perspective (outside the watch), he just deserted, and made up a bullshit story. They have no reason to believe him, but they choose to follow him either way.

Fair point regarding Melisandre, though. I still don't think it makes it obvious that she was going to resurrect someone, however. She could just have been very interested in how this drunken priest is capable of bringing someone back to life, and it makes for interesting conversation."

9797,gameofthrones,"See this is why it's a problem.  Show watchers have no concept of distance or time in the ASOIAF world. 

By the [most accurate map](http://quartermaester.info/) I could find, they traveled around 7000 miles by sea.  An average cog's speed in favorable wind conditions, and basing this off historical accounts of ship travel speed, they could achieve 4-6 knots on average, so we'll even it out to 6mph.  If they sailed nonstop with constant wind, which is physically impossible by the way, that would be around 49 days.  You're probably saying now, well just add a few more days to account for other variables and that's it!.  However, it cannot be overstated how inconstant wind is, it is possible to have days or weeks without adequate wind (depending on ship/sail size), not to mention allowing for storms/weather, stops at port for food/supplies/repairs, and any navigational set backs from sailing into unfamiliar waters.  To put this into perspective, Alexandria to Massilia, based of recordings and estimations, a distance of 2700 miles by plane, so probably around 3000 by sea, could be more depending on winds/ports/passages, was recorded and estimated to have taken 58‑78 days.  If we compound that to our 7000, that's easily 135-180 days.  Now considering the Iron islands ships were smaller 1-2 mast ships, not full sized cogs, their speed in open ocean would be even slower.  Would that make it double the 135-180?  I can't say, but I think I've proved the point that the temporal inconsistencies in the shows leads to misinformation for the viewers."

9836,gameofthrones,"Yes, Sansa comes with an in to three kingdoms and the show is to end with a similar ending to the books.   Though with the books, Martin has Tyrion as a villain and the relationship was quite cold.  Sansa had her armor on all the time around him, she didn’t trust him.   It was a toxic relationship that terrified her.   Martin isn’t going to build her up, then toss her back to the imp, when it would just destroy everything of her arc.   

In the books, Tyrion had every intention to fuck Sansa on their wedding night, what stopped him is that she was terrified.  He made a deal to only come to her when she wanted and her response, “and if I never.....” that will remain true, even as she matures.  She was forced to marry him and it is a reminder of the torment she suffered under Joffrey and the Lannisters, which she will never forget.  But I guess fuck that, let’s just toss her to him and give the Lannisters more power again.   

Sansa deserves someone she can love and feel safe with, that will never be Tyrion."

9951,gameofthrones,"He's largely blamed for demoting pluto, ever since then the circlejerk has slowly made him a hard figure. Same thing happened with jennifer Lawrence, she was loved by the reddit circlejerk and then there was a turning point and it slowly turned from the circlejerk hyping every moment of her existence to hating even the exact same things they praised months before.

The circlejerk is a temperamental bitch sometimes. "
9952,gameofthrones,Was actually thinking about that song as I was posting lol
9953,gameofthrones,"Even once he snaps out of it and becomes Theon Greyjoy again, you can tell he isn't the same. He's back, but he's meek and keeps to himself a lot. He doesn't have that confidence or arrogance he used to have.

He needs to find his confidence again and I think he'll do just that and be the one to strike down Euron.

I think Theon is just like Jorah and The Hound. They're all tragic heroes who are currently on their redemption arcs."

9963,gameofthrones,"With that line of reasoning more gun shops would be going out of business. 

But really I like to think that most people would allow these slavers to continue on because they think in the back of their mind they are thinking that they can always come back if they need more. "
9964,gameofthrones,"He didn't? He first went to Ned, then hugged Cat, then ruffled Rickon's hair, then shook hands with Robb, then spoke to Sansa, and _then_ went to Arya. He never went to Arya straight away. 

And even then no one apart from Ned and Winterfell people really comment on how she looked like Lyanna."
9965,gameofthrones,Off map
9966,gameofthrones,i think its more that the audience liked Jaqen so they used the same actor and character. But makes no sense lore wise imo.
9967,gameofthrones,"Well in all fairness to Jon, he was invited first by Dany to join her cause. He only recently learned that there was Dragonglass on Dragonstone, so he took it as an opportune time to bring the issue to her, because he knows it must be done for the good of everyone or they will all die. He understands Dany's dilemma, and hates the Lannistera,  but he knows what is more important."
9968,gameofthrones,Not to mention Sansa is turning cruel

There is a GRRM collection at a university library somewhere in Texas that holds tons of his manuscripts and notes. Somebody I don’t know at some point a few years ago visited and shared photos of many of the manuscript pages. I’d love to point you to a specific source, but I just don’t remember :( I bet you could find them online, though, or if you’re in Texas you can go visit the collection!"
9994,gameofthrones,Maybe the reason the Tyrells are so rich is because they don't bankrupt themselves building a castle?

10055,gameofthrones,Beautiful​ artwork. How long does it take you to do something that expressive? 
10056,gameofthrones,I think she had other immediate concerns what with the High Sparrow and all that. I'm pretty sure the first thing Cersei's going to do next season is declare war on Dorne.
10057,gameofthrones,"You see I think her acting and her character were brilliant in the last 3 seasons. The whole point was her getting to this moment. Seriously rewatch season 4, 5 and 6 and see that she actually nails the performance. Look at the scenes with Jorah and Tyrion, the scene where she has to lock away her dragons, or when the farmer comes with his daughters bones. She is actually incredible. Her character too. It builds and builds into what she was this season.

I usually have a favorite character each season whose story was the strongest in that season, this season for me goes to Daenerys. This is one of the main reasons I disliked the mad queen theories. People were so focused on that happening that they don't see the great story and character unfolding in front of them. Her being so strong and stoic a lot of the time is her character, it's what makes her emotional scenes like this and season 6's
Jorah scene so heartbreaking. You can see the real Daenerys break out from the ruler status she's built and has to keep.

I also feel this season Emilia Clarke outdid Lena Headey... I said it. I think the emmy will go to her."

If you go back and read GoT, this seems to be clearly what he is setting up in the early chapters. But we are now five books in and Daeny has barely even gotten rolling. The white walker plotline is a huge dangling thread that's barely been explored. We are still basically stuck in Stark v. Lannister territory."")"

I knew I fucking had him during that scene with Sansa and Littlefinger in the crypts of Winterfell where they were discussing Lyanna and she said ""And then Rhaegar kidnaped and raped her"" and Littlefinger hesitated and gave her a look of..pity/condescension like when you hear kids talking about something they don't know the full truth about.

10119,gameofthrones,"""Oh yeah and we got married and fucked in Dorne. Sorry. Don't worry, I'll send a fruit basket to Sunspear as an apology."" 

I'm surprised he didn't ask Lewyn Martell(Kingsguard, Elia's uncle) to come along and guard the door while he fucked Lyanna at the rate he did things lol 
"
10120,gameofthrones,Poor J-bear :(
10121,gameofthrones,"He could just fly over them and rain fire down. Not much they can do when he's out of reach. I don't know how effective arrows would be against his armor. I guess the only problem would be sustainability. How long can he go, does he have to recharge the suit or something?"
10122,gameofthrones,"""What the capitol of Iceland?""
""Reykjavik.""
""...Is that still a sport?"""
10123,gameofthrones,Didn’t they say that about this past season as well? 
10124,gameofthrones,SMASH THE BEETLES KUHKUHKUHKUH
10125,gameofthrones,20 proper young lads
10126,gameofthrones,"It would be “effected by” if I meant that the laws were created by the group. “Affected by” would mean that the laws were changed by the group

Edit: this [source](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/affect-or-effect) has a quote which supports what I’m saying: “Growth in the economy can only be effected by stringent economic controls.”"
10127,gameofthrones,What about the undead mammoth mount?
10128,gameofthrones,I'd buy one too
10129,gameofthrones,"I'd love to hear him read audiobooks, he has an awesome voice."

10133,gameofthrones,LMAYO**
10134,gameofthrones,How does he look simultaneously fat and ripped?
10135,gameofthrones,I said two is more than enough to support the beams three is too much
10136,gameofthrones,"FFS, there's ALREADY one One-Handed Lannister!"
10137,gameofthrones,"Oh, thanks. Guess I should get around to watching Community"
10138,gameofthrones,IIRC the books state that dragons like Balerion actually did
10139,gameofthrones,Where is the con?
10140,gameofthrones,She did Triss - http://i.imgur.com/QxSdWgB.jpg
10141,gameofthrones,However it’s very cheap solution to simply tell the actors to say that. 
10142,gameofthrones,So doing this 
10143,gameofthrones,What is flayed may never die
10144,gameofthrones,I absolutely love this. Would pay good money to see a 2hr featured film.

10146,gameofthrones,I'm saying he couldn't pull it off. Not Bowie
10147,gameofthrones,Oh fuck.
10148,gameofthrones,Somebody tell Derek this guy is stealing Blue Steel.
10149,gameofthrones,A Lannister always lays his bets. 
10150,gameofthrones,We’re in the endgame now. 
10151,gameofthrones,"My mom’s an Auburn alum. She told me, “If you see someone wearing an Auburn shirt, they most likely went to Auburn.”

I asked her, “What if they’re wearing an Alabama shirt?”

“They most likely went to Walmart.”"
10152,gameofthrones,"I'm not sure why Jaime changed  (in-universe, I mean).   The easiest explanation I can think of is that he was inspired by Brienne's devotion to duty during their long trek to King's Landing.


"
10153,gameofthrones,The scene where he had all those wights on him - I was literally screaming NOOoooo000 at my TV screen. I think I might be more devastated if he died than if Jon died. 
10154,gameofthrones,"People who wear those to a wedding die even faster.

Source: Tywin Lannister."
10155,gameofthrones,"Are you deaf, boy?"
10156,gameofthrones,It's awesome bro. But just don't use that in public while hanging out with your sister.
10157,gameofthrones,"Hell, the even the Sandor was made more pretty. Plus, Tormund isn't short and fat."
10158,gameofthrones,Almost every random wildling death made you wonder if it was one of the main guys even though we all knew it wasn't.
10159,gameofthrones,"Ironically, I think Jon is also one of those people. Just not to the extent that he would put traditions above everything else without question."
10160,gameofthrones,"Yeah, man. He took his hammer and smashed the whole iron fleet."
10161,gameofthrones,"Agreed, he would fall apart. I don't imagine Mace would take it well either. Kind of bungles up the whole Tyrell-Lannister alliance"
10162,gameofthrones,I don't think there is any reason to think that it has anything to do with what happened or what will happen. It's just a cool looking visual.
10163,gameofthrones,[deleted]
10164,gameofthrones,Yes it is☺️
10165,gameofthrones,Sean bean didn't even go to season 2. 
10166,gameofthrones,"Let's try hanging, that's a good trick!"

edit: side not sode"
10169,gameofthrones,"Tbh, I had never heard of Dark tower book that recent. The last one I read was from early 2000. Thank you for letting me know, though!

Edit: oh wow it’s a prequel to Wolves? I should read that!"
10170,gameofthrones,*everyone else burns externally*

10176,gameofthrones,"Margaret John,  who played Old Nan,  passed away in February 2011, before the show started airing. J.J. Murphy,  who played Ser Denys,  passed away in 2014,  also before his appearance in season 5 ever aired."
10177,gameofthrones,This guy knows his shorts and is correct. 
10178,gameofthrones,Damn this guy deserve a medal after that. Looks great!
10179,gameofthrones,"""trees are more secure""

""they're trees Bran, they're hackable""

A+. "
10180,gameofthrones,All Jon knows is to kill White walkers and slap ass. 
10181,gameofthrones,The level of commitment...
10182,gameofthrones,"First time Ramin Djawadi brought in the Piano as a main element, which makes ""Light of the Seven"" even more dramatic, just perfect for the scenes it is played in.
"
10183,gameofthrones,Tywon?
10184,gameofthrones,"Makeup, before filming a multi million dollar series? Preposterous"
10185,gameofthrones,"Seriously, are we not doing phrasing anymore?"
10186,gameofthrones,Littlefinger dies by the end of the season. I think he won't even make it to the finale. He'll pit Arya against Sansa and fail spectacularly.
10187,gameofthrones,"Roose describes the size of the North in miles to Ramsay. ""700 miles in that direction, you're still in the North."""
10188,gameofthrones,10/10!!
10189,gameofthrones,"What I haven’t seen, and don’t think they’ll be much of this season, is Context for Non-Book readers. Anyone know what happened to those? I think it was from /u/GRVrush2112"
10190,gameofthrones,Where's Ser Twenty Goodmen when you need him?
10191,gameofthrones,"Honestly, dragon breath seems to be the most fair execution method we've seen apart from in the North. There would not be much time for pain and suffering with flames that intense and direct. "
10192,gameofthrones,"You forgot the most important part...

""And I will"""
10193,gameofthrones,[removed]
10194,gameofthrones,I bound that book at work and I felt so honored lol
10195,gameofthrones,Isn't Euron's gift the dragon horn?
10196,gameofthrones,Crop circles are getting out of hand. 
10197,gameofthrones,You got any vanillllla wafers?
10198,gameofthrones,"I don't see why he wouldn't dress like a Westerlander still. For more evidence, Kevan and Cersei are also dressed similarly in the show. Sometimes the most obvious and boring explanation is the most plausible."
10199,gameofthrones,Go on... 
10200,gameofthrones,"Nice, I'd love to see more like what the Faith Militant, Faceless men, Unsullied, and Dorthraki would have. Although the last one would be obvious but still."
10201,gameofthrones,If they didn't leave Ser Davos behind it could've been the Fellowship of the Onion Ring.
10202,gameofthrones,"Littlefinger has become more of a central character in this series than Sansa, imo. I just don't see him or Varys dying until very late in the game, and I wouldn't find that to be a satisfying end to his arc at all. "
10203,gameofthrones,"Considering that they used to actually sell them on their website for $30000, I hope it's not just shitty plastic"
10204,gameofthrones,Isn't he burning the supplies Dany needed?
10205,gameofthrones,Aw shucks.. thank you!! I will remind myself of this as well ☺️
10206,gameofthrones,Never have I had so much of a man-crush on anyone more than Alistair.
10207,gameofthrones,"Eh, we'll clean it up in Post."
10208,gameofthrones,You’re asking for literally the biggest spoiler of the show so far. 
10209,gameofthrones,They most likely weren't ready yet. Why start showing themselves to the free folk around the last 3 years instead of the earlier winters?
10210,gameofthrones,Were you ever a stand in/photo double for anyone cool?
10211,gameofthrones,"""lower"" budget than this episode..
"
10212,gameofthrones,Fucking Bran and Barry Allen
10213,gameofthrones,"Made a thread about this that got no traction, very interesting topic. "
10214,gameofthrones,I'm going to marry in a couple months. This is a wonderful idea! Really nice!
10215,gameofthrones,Where do whores go?
10216,gameofthrones,"Ah, I see. Like I said I haven't watched the early seasons in a while, so I don't remember. However, only two instances really isn't a lot, but I can see a case being made for it."
10217,gameofthrones,"Oh shit, gotta change my flair right now."
10218,gameofthrones,Yeah... A level is a cheap commodity....
10219,gameofthrones,Clodor Clegane? 
10220,gameofthrones,And from the way she moves... I can almost here her  fighting sounds when she does that little like twitch back and the position of her sword arm after she strikes. It's pretty distinctive. 
10221,gameofthrones,"Man, you *get* it. "
10222,gameofthrones,Double XD 
10223,gameofthrones,No they are not. I watch the show and read the books. Many Targs have died by fire. You don't know what you're talking about.
10224,gameofthrones,He could also get revenge on Ned by destroying the Lannisters and taking Kingslanding with the Tyrells.
10225,gameofthrones,"Eh they are 2 of the weakest actors of th series, doubt they wil win."
10226,gameofthrones,Ho Door.
10227,gameofthrones,That's not you
10228,gameofthrones,"Jesus, Oona Chaplin is fucking *gorgeous*"
10229,gameofthrones,That was beautifully poetic. 
10230,gameofthrones,"Serious question, does this mean we are traveling into a ""time loop"" issue with the show?"
10231,gameofthrones,"It was a joke my man but also obligatory 

*WHY ARE YOU BOOING, IM RIGHT*"
10232,gameofthrones,"I mean that's true. But I just don't think it's that huge of an issue, since it's relatively early on, and not one of the most important issues. Sure, it closes some doors, and opens others, especially a certain pathway followed later on, but idk."
10233,gameofthrones,"Benjen told Bran he goes around trying to lower their numbers. He probably was following some and went ""where the fuck is everyone"" and followed the trail. He was probably got there before Jon got out and was wondering what they were waiting for. "
10234,gameofthrones,"I mean that in the aftermath no one won, Jon survived, but his forces were nearly destroyed, If Ramsey had won his own forces would be nearly destroyed, with the needless firing on his own men etc. 


To be fair, there's no way Ramsey should have come out of winterfell, in the real world he wins that fight 9/10 times by waiting it out, that was his tactical failing. "
10235,gameofthrones,I think if anything happens with Jon and the night king it'll be them killing each other at the same time somehow. 
10236,gameofthrones,Ep10 is now my favourite ep of the entire show. 
10237,gameofthrones,Yes! I bought one for my sister from Etsy a few years ago. 
10238,gameofthrones,That's Ross O'Donovan!
10239,gameofthrones,"The ability to kill off central characters without a second thought has to work to the studio's advantage in contract negotiations. The friends cast had far far more negotiating power and, besides that, I can't imagine GoT is more profitable."
10240,gameofthrones,Was Fred Armisen just the first guy that came to mind...?
10241,gameofthrones,"I wouldn't go around provoking Elon Musk to bend the knee... he's a passionate person, might really start a war here"
10242,gameofthrones,"Baby, it will be."
10243,gameofthrones,No Cersei or Yara? 
10244,gameofthrones,"Once she gives Tommen an heir, she isn't strictly needed anymore"
10245,gameofthrones,Survival skills in Westeros: don't go anywhere near anybody political. Jon is King in the North now so Edd's gonna die soon.
10246,gameofthrones,And he was in a pool!! Of blood.
10247,gameofthrones,The Hound pulls out a Dragonglass hatchet after dropping Gendry's hammer.
10248,gameofthrones,Keep walking!
10249,gameofthrones,Or Bran isn't some how both Brandon Stark & the NK but they are both just Greenseers? 
10250,gameofthrones,Stun double*
10251,gameofthrones,This is amazing. 
10252,gameofthrones,I live here!! I saw this today!
10253,gameofthrones,"Idk. A man like Jon Snow or Ned, people who value honor, loyalty, and integrity more than anything, would've chosen Missandei. Someone like Cersei, who only value strenght, might have picked Grey Worm. 
Tyrion didn't came to convince her that he should be her hand, he came to convince himself that she should be his queen. That's more or less what he tells her when he first meets her. 

She saw that he wanted respect and recognition at their first meeting, just as Tyrion saw what strenght she had."
10254,gameofthrones,The Lord of Castle Aaaa^aaaa^rrrr^ggh

10256,gameofthrones,"Yeah I barely remember him in the books beyond ""the dude who fucked with Theon"". Same with Tormund. Still, he is way way too evil to keep around as villain for too long. You can only cut a dudes dick off once and there really aren't many places you can go from there on TV."
10257,gameofthrones,Now THIS is podricking!
10258,gameofthrones,Holy shit. You could quite literally be Arya’s twin. Stunt double maybe??
10259,gameofthrones,"i love you, stranger. think i've seen your username before too"
10260,gameofthrones,"I think so too. Hopefully more people make TV shows out of complex literature series.

I for one want to see a TV adaptation of the Silmarillion in my lifetime."
10261,gameofthrones,Eskimo cousins. 
10262,gameofthrones,"About as many times as I've said it about ""The Walking Dead.""

But I fucking MEAN IT THIS TIME, show runners."
10263,gameofthrones,Well... if rickons and shaggy dog's story is the same in the books as the show when the time comes. I hope it isn't shaggy...
10264,gameofthrones,Tis beautiful :')
10265,gameofthrones,It's not like his arms are broken!
10266,gameofthrones,"Not Impressive because the Sept is still there/not accurate

2/10 - could have been a better recreation.

10267,gameofthrones,"It's worth noting, that House Baelish is actually a house of the Vale already. The Mockingbird is his personal sigil, and the house's sigil used to be the head of the Titan of Braavos. "

10273,gameofthrones,"i don't think any of the lord of Vale would care if Littlefinger died, they only follow him because he has Robin wrapped around his finger "
10274,gameofthrones,You drank way too much bud light to make this possible. 
10275,gameofthrones,She is a bitch in Season 1 to Arya. 
10276,gameofthrones,Oh wow!
10277,gameofthrones,Ugh! Why can't I up vote this more than once
10278,gameofthrones,"No, you *joined* the Martell house. That's amazing! Didn't realize this was a craft until this post. Thanks"
10279,gameofthrones,Wow that was the last episode I saw last night. Nice.
10280,gameofthrones,[removed]
10281,gameofthrones,Except Ellaria would somewhat deserve it unlike the starks.
10282,gameofthrones,I don't think she would even want to kill him if she finds out he's alive. He was the closest thing she had to a father since Ned.
10283,gameofthrones,Peak. 
10284,gameofthrones,Maybe they just don't have access to that many horses in the true North
10285,gameofthrones,"I mean yeah, but he wasn't wrong..."
10286,gameofthrones,"It's kind of funny too how there actually *is* truth to the berating. We've always loved Tyrion, but in no small part it was *because* he was cynical, bitter, lustful and devil-may-care. (not to mention blithely entitled) He was so in a fun and endearing way, but as a statesman in their world? Tywin did kind of have a point. But the Tyrion we've seen in Mereen has drifted from all of these qualities, to the point where Tywin basically would accept who he is today. Other than the prejudice he has against Tyrion's physical stature, that is. "
10287,gameofthrones,Looking the part is part of his job though. 
10288,gameofthrones,"I agree with your point that people are majorly over-reacting, but it's a stupid move using the term ""non-consensual sex."" Sex is either consensual or its rape, and using a weak-ass made-up euphemism doesn't make your argument any stronger.

And trauma/grief triggers are a real thing. There are a hell of a lot more women watching GoT that have been raped than there dudes who've had their dicks mutilated or molten gold poured on their head. Again, I agree that the overall reaction is overkill but those people who were triggered still deserve some fucking empathy."
10289,gameofthrones,Fair enough
10290,gameofthrones,"And the hurt look on Dickon's face. He seemed like a pretty good fellow, all things considered. "
10291,gameofthrones,Could happen pretty soon given how DC is really screwing the pooch on their cinematic universe so far
10292,gameofthrones,"First episode, a stag (symbol of Baretheon) and a dire wolf (symbol of Stark) die while fighting one another."
10293,gameofthrones,MELONLORD!

10299,gameofthrones,I love that name. I wonder who will inherit that sword in the story. 
10300,gameofthrones,I guess there is something to be said of his honor. But why not live on and carry the Tarly name?
10301,gameofthrones,you idiots! you captured the stunt double 
10302,gameofthrones,Mybaelish.png
10303,gameofthrones,if it's not a face tattoo you aren't a real fan
10304,gameofthrones,"I said it in another comment up there. Yara is an Iron Islander, I'm sure she doesn't grasp the torturing he suffered, but to her he needs to man up. Sansa has been through a lot, but she wants the North back. The difference is Yara has fought in wars and seen what was accomplished. She advised her father to leave the mainland. Sansa just wants Jon to retake their home. She won't have to fight. She will wait this out and hope for the best. It's very easy for Sansa to say man up, when she doesn't really understand what war can do to people. "
10305,gameofthrones,"Jaime back then was stupid and brash, but he wasn't that much of a dumbass. He figured the odds of him getting away with throwing Bran out the window were high, as it would be believable he fell. Ambushing and killing the King's best friend in the streets in broad daylight with no shortage of witnesses, however, he would not be able to get away with."
10306,gameofthrones,"I literally just did a full rewatch last month and dont remember the waif and jaqen swapping faces, can you remember when that was?"
10307,gameofthrones,"On Dragonstone, that island is actually pretty big."
10308,gameofthrones,Yeah. Not exactly the type of game to play with an audience a good chunk of the time. 
10309,gameofthrones,dc please :'(
10310,gameofthrones,Serious question: what the actual fuck is he shooting now? Is it ice? Blue flame? Something else entirely?
10311,gameofthrones,I about died when he said that in the last episode.
10312,gameofthrones,Har!
10313,gameofthrones,You could burn a toddler in my pantaloons
10314,gameofthrones,Swole as fuck
10315,gameofthrones,"Black Sails is amazing, I'd rate it even higher than GoT. You should definitely give it a shot. A warning though, the first few eps are mediocre at best so that turns a lot of people off the show. If you can get past them though, it's all uphill onwards. The show just gets even better with every season."
10316,gameofthrones,"Game of Thrones (the Franchise) was not a mega huge thing at that time.  Many authors will answer you personally if you contact them.

Hell, Brian Sanderson who is CRAZY successful is all over the subreddits about his books. He's /u/mistborn"
10317,gameofthrones,What the shit is this.
10318,gameofthrones,"Say word.  After the fire she was spittin, everyone just twiddings their thumbs hoping she doesn't put their house on blast. "
10319,gameofthrones,"I sit on it right after morning coffee. And also at the end of the day, since you asked."
10320,gameofthrones,"Saying ""you lost, leave"" and that I shouldn't bother to keep this going just because you're a musician doesn't entitle you to end an argument.  I'm a musician too, and I'm not going to sit here and pretend that makes me automatically smarter than you when it comes to music or an auditive experience.  

You're right, it is an auditive experience, and if people like it, whatever.  I think it's fucking weird.  That's my *opinion*. I shouldn't have to clarify this because my first comment was very obviously my opinion.  

And yes, if I don't like it, I'm allowed to say it's the dumbest shit ever.  Just like you're allowed to like it.

"
10321,gameofthrones,"I did! It truly feels like your the only human being around in that forest. Walking up the paradise path was exhausting, but absolutely worth it. The nude beach was a bit unexpected, but convenient."
10322,gameofthrones,This scene DID make me feel a little better about my Brazilian appt next week.
10323,gameofthrones,I would have loved to also see King Robert and Oberyn with Ellaria.
10324,gameofthrones,"Start your day with a cup of ayahuasca, followed by Ketamine for a light breakfast. Upon climbing out of your hole you'll want a ten strip of blotter for lunch, followed by more ketamine. Be sure to rip as many dabs as you can before returning to your hole. Helps with the whole ""sight"" thing. Careful not to burn yourself from the torch or nail, no worries if you do, you won't feel it anyway. For dinner the ayahuasca should be wearing off so that should accompany the quarter of boomers you'll be feasting on. No throwing up now that's wasteful, let your liver and kidneys boss it for you. Use a sinus wash to clear out your nose so you can have your k for dessert. Careful not to look in the mirror, as all three eyed ravens know that while you see everything, that is a portal you do not step into. Repeat dabs. Next morning when the L wears off and you find yourself naked in a bush outside your sisters window, go talk to her you all knowing 3 eyed raven, you."
10325,gameofthrones,This guy gets it.
10326,gameofthrones,"Why? I know two people with white blond hair and the have hella dark eyebrows. And no, they don't dye their hair"
10327,gameofthrones,"> In short, negative numbers mean something is less likely to happen, positive numbers mean something is more likely to happen.

That's backwards right? Jon is at -1000. He is the most likely to make it out alive.  Negative means most likely to happen, so you get the least payout for your bet."
10328,gameofthrones,"His ass was also told a few other things he chose to ignore. RIP Hodor. 😞

I think that this is the most obvious explanation, so that makes me think it's the least likely. "

10331,gameofthrones,All we had was some morning reported come not once but twice and the fucked up part was when they slash and sprayed painted his news car.

10336,gameofthrones,Me too! I was waiting for it to be a ruse. Took so long to get used to.
10337,gameofthrones,"the whole show's been cheesy since the ""bad pussy"" line"
10338,gameofthrones,Please draw Little Valyrians. They're one of my favorite animals in the GoT universe! 
10339,gameofthrones,Sending mail to the moon requires additional postage 
10340,gameofthrones,"Off topic, but how much does it cost to set something up like that in your apartment? Like is it just a stand for a bike that you can ride on? Is it loud for neighbors/roommates? Is it one of those things you need to go for the higher end versions because the cheaper versions can be hazardous/dangerous/break/fall easily? 

Sorry, I just love biking but live in a rainy and hot part of the world so it's not always feasible. "
10341,gameofthrones,His name is Ethan Winter.

10344,gameofthrones,"I agree, she's a perfect adaptation ! As much as I love Emilia sometimes I wish they did have a younger actress. I mean she's supposed to be the same age as sansa!"
10345,gameofthrones,"One dragon glass tipped arrow and the Ice Dragon dies. 

Wildfire should take care of most of the dead.

A few dragon glass cluster bombs takes care of the rest.

Two Living Dragons can turn the Night King cunt into a cinder.

I am not impressed. 20 good men is all I'd need.

10349,gameofthrones,Was she not the little Ballsy Demon Queen?  Loved her!
10350,gameofthrones,Well he IS Bobby B's son. Only the son of such a beautiful man would be that juicy.
10351,gameofthrones,I'm surprised Oberyn was that well liked considering he isn't a super major character in the books or show
10352,gameofthrones,"I'm not sure how to interpret that. I genuinely can't tell if that's a ""compliment""/a positive thing or not."
10353,gameofthrones,"I believe that Jon will be received by House Manderly as a true Stark. Episode 7 synopsis says that ""The North is reminded"". I think this does not only mean that they remember the Starks rule the North, but also that Wyman Manderly remembers that Robb legitimized Jon and chose him as his heir as the Kind of the North.

Far fetched, but it could be true. That is how they get all the other houses to support Jon & Co.

Wyman Manderly wasn't in fact present when Robb chose his heir (not named) in the books but this scene never existed in the series. D&D could do some changes and make Wyman say that it happened and he was there..."

10359,gameofthrones,I hope he isn't typecast after GoT. He shows he can play a good hero in Misfits.
10360,gameofthrones,He's passed on. He's expired and gone to meet his maker. He's run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. That... is an ex-Benjen.

10366,gameofthrones,"Eh.. I loved Dragonlance when I was 13 and playing D&D.. got some serious nostalgia after reading ASOIAF 20 years later.. saw Dragons of Twilight in the bookstore and started down memory lane looking for favorite bits in the series (Raistlin's trial, Lord Soth etc) but was disappointed the writing wasn't nearly as great as I remembered. Really derivative, made-for-TSR stuff.  Teen fantasy and definitely on the same shelf as Martin. Belongs on another bookcase altogether. "
10367,gameofthrones,waiting for the youtube of that battle scene with i see fire dubbed over it
10368,gameofthrones,Do you happen to know/theorize why it was advantageous to have a shorter snout as compared to a longer snout?
10369,gameofthrones,What program was used to make that?
10370,gameofthrones,"I mean, you’re not wrong."
10371,gameofthrones,"I think it just comes down to why you watch GoT. Moments or intrigue. Both of course, but I will always favor moments over intrigue. Last season focused on moments."
10372,gameofthrones,"And Jon is quite literally the protector of the Seven Kingdoms, uniting previously sworn enemies to fight the true enemy.

10381,gameofthrones,<3 np
10382,gameofthrones,This looks great and love the style- if you’re looking to improve it I think it could be enhanced by making his right shoulder a downward angle about 25 degrees(its flat like horizon atm and makes it feel stale) and also the spot between his eyebrows- it looks like you gave him a unibrow/ gets super muddy there/gives impression his eyes are too close together.
10383,gameofthrones,The coworker was probably right handed

10385,gameofthrones,"I tell you what, that queen ain't right."
10386,gameofthrones,If they actually cared about hitting more than one dragon then they would have had more spears and they would have all thrown a spear at the same time. The whole thing was calculated (or bad writing).
10387,gameofthrones,And my axe!
10388,gameofthrones,I read it was meth.
10389,gameofthrones,"Yeah let me tell you: don't set the bar too high for yourself. Build some levels, play them, let some friends play them and find out which kind of levels you want to design before you get into complicated stuff.
Always remember, gameplay comes first and graphics are only secondary.

Then there's a ton of different styles of levels you can build. Find out in which you are most comfortable and then build what you can imagine.

For me the category was glitch puzzle like for example Super Nerv World or Super Puzzle World 3 by two german Hackers :D"

10436,gameofthrones,"US Civil law stems deeply from European Civil law.  I think it's called ""Justinian"" law, maybe?  So Civil rules are probably pretty similar in the EU.

A big hint as to the difference in civil vs. criminal cases is that in a civil case, neither party is ever proclaimed ""guilty."" Instead, the judge simply rules in favor of one party or the other.

Therefore, since you can only be ""guilty"" of criminal charges, ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a concept that can only be applied to criminal charges.  And this is done to prevent the state from punishing people until due process has been carried out.  The idea was to prevent the state from abusing their power over a citizen.

In a civil situation, it's one citizen against another. In theory, neither citizen would have the power of a nation-state available to abuse, and would be, in fact, peers.  In such a situation, putting the burden of proof entirely on one party or the other was deemed to be more offensive than the problems caused by splitting the burden evenly. 

I know not the specifics of how or why, and I see problems with all 3 options (plaintiff, defendant, both).  Rather than worry about that, though, I've just made a really good habit of not doing things that get me taken to civil or criminal court."

10478,gameofthrones,"Just my head canon. Obviously the unfinished storylines are not unimportant, but when thinking about, say, what did Varys actually do, I’m gonna go with the show storyline and not consider anything in the AFFC and ADWD that contradicts that. Because those storylines have no resolution and no effect on the only ending to the story that exists."

10488,gameofthrones,Sweet reven- *Squish* 
10489,gameofthrones,"What I'm thinking is how those Starks don't give a fuck about their duty as lords of winterfell. Ok, not Robb, but next in the line of succession is Bran and he just ""Nah, I'm a tree and it doesn't have anything to do with my age, that's how I feel"". Next comes Rickon ""Nah, I'm out"", next comes Benjen ""There's no time"". Seriously, the only one of Starks who care about Winterfell is Sansa, all the others are like ""nah, I'm outta here, need to save the world and other stuff'."
10490,gameofthrones,"I'd rather have the Dance of Dragons series. Full on Targaryen civil war with dragons fighting dragons? Hell yeah. We get to see houses like the Hightowers, Valyrians, and House Redwyne actually do something! Roddy the Ruin and the Winter's Wolves. A freaking dragon rider fight in Harrenhal. Navy battles actually being important. Greyjoys making the right call this time and raiding the rich south. God I want to see this on screen."
10491,gameofthrones,"Well, Daenerys had 8k trained unsullied at first, but also untrained unsullied went with her (I suppose something around 5k), after that she added the whole khalasar, khal drogo had around 60k, but when she burnt all the leaders its said that the whole khalasar have 100k people, maybe less of them can fight but who knows. 

Then, you have the Starks. Probably, they have around 10k people, with more and more people training , as he said that even every child should go and fight - so let's say 15k. The knights of the vale has a huge army, Lysa never really used them. So let's say more than 15k. Thare you have 135...

Few of the danys army died during the fights, but she never lost a huge amount of people. You can compromise them by counting on Jamie! He will probably take some loyal soldiers and what about the dornish army. In the 6th season they were ready to fight, full of anger but they didn't do anything nor they didn't join Daenerys or somebody else. Plus you have the largest dragon Drogon, and when I watched some videos some people assume that Vyserion is only a third or half of Drogon, you can see the difference when night King approach Vyserion and Jon snow approaching drogon. "
10492,gameofthrones,He said that the biggest inspiration for how he played the role was taken from Joaquin Phoenix when he played the Caesar in Gladiator. You can absolutely see it.
10493,gameofthrones,"This is no small feat,if you think about it 6 X 80 min = 480 min with almost the same production of a major motion picture, 4 fucking movies in a year! That's crazy we're lucky its coming out early 2019"

10501,gameofthrones,"Also she only poisoned one person. I am guessing the gods really don't care that much when its small stuff like that, even if its an important person. You have to remember, the Frey's didn't just murder the people in that room, they also slaughtered pretty much all of the Stark army. Thousands and thousands of people were killed. Thats amuch bigger attention getter imo."

10508,gameofthrones,"i think the dragon breath needs to be charged, so it cant spam"
10509,gameofthrones,That's completely different.  The Titanic was the setting.  The plot was about the characters.  And the spectacle was about seeing the ship sinking.  Knowing the ending of Titanic would be knowing whether or not the main characters died.
10510,gameofthrones,"don't forget the last server that Bran used was literally DDOS-ed by ice zombies...

10512,gameofthrones,"A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."
10513,gameofthrones,"I don't think this is going to happen for the same reason why the the Night King wasn't destroyed in  the previous episode. 

The MVP of the Army of the Dead was in the immediate vicinity of the three most powerful weapons of the Army of the Living.

Why Jon didn't immediately start yelling at Daenerys to destroy the chief ice demon 300 yards away as soon as she showed up, is because this is television. "

But keep in mind that with Actors, the DP ALSO adds multiple lights (source and bounce cards) to sculpt the lighting on an actor (in addition to the general set lighting). That can't really be done as specifically for the CG creatures (and they don't always take the time to do it given the pressures of making a shooting day) - so very talented Digital Artists are deployed to enhance the lighting on the CG creatures to make them look like this was done during photography.

Plus, you need really talented VFX artists creating the textures for CG Creatures so they look photoreal, as well as Compositors who put the whole thing together at the end of the day. (plus all the other animators and artists!)"

Edit: another prediction: the night king will eventually sack winterfell. I mean doesn't it make sense? You can't have a supernatural enemy unseen for 8,000 years get stopped by the wall or first line of castles. In which case, winterfell will fall... right as winter fell."

By naming his 2 sons the same names.

No but seriously your logic is dumb. Why would a (loving) father want his sons to compete for the title? Don't get me wrong, naming two sons the same name isn't particularly smart or common, but it has nothing to do with competing for the title of king, since a father wouldn't have this in mind for his children.

10715,gameofthrones,"I think it’s more about getting people hyped. Through watch-parties and “water cooler talk.”

Also it’s likely the season was well made and the advertising is for the critical community, since HBO is looking to win as many award as they can, while they ramp up Westworld and other shows (like a new Curb season).

Lastly, HBO is apart of AT&T now, and they are trying to promote not only a rumored streaming service (built off of DirectTV). But just advertising the hottest show of this generation, in it’s final season, gets at the minimum, new HBO subs, even if it’s just for this show/season. That’s their income, that’s why they’re doing this.

I don’t think you thought what you said through."

Then, I read just about every book from Brandon Sanderson.  Then, I read the entire Dark Tower collection...to give a little perspective of how long I’ve been waiting,

Eventually, I decided the next book isn’t coming, and I incorporated the show into my workouts.  And now, I wish that I had waited longer until the final season has finished."
10728,gameofthrones,You can't yet.
10729,gameofthrones,This season is well and truly over now. 
10730,gameofthrones,I read that as being able to live the life of an ancient dragon queen.
10731,gameofthrones,"I agree. I think her hatred for Jon was unfortunate but not an intentional needed part of the lie on Ned's part. I choose to believe he would have told her at some point, especially since Jon was headed to the Nights Watch. I never liked Cat, in books or show. She was selfish and proud."
10732,gameofthrones,You looked beautiful in your aunt.
10733,gameofthrones,"Let me quote Barney Stinson on this: ""King Joffrey's parents were brother and sister and he was a fair and wise leader."""
10734,gameofthrones,"I'm not quite sure why this scene is singled out as an example of bad CGI on social media. It looks believable to me, and I haven't noticed any new mistakes in probably 5 viewings of this scene. 

I'm guessing it's because we know it's CGI, whereas a castle could be a clever use of perspective/location. You don't get the luxury of mystery with something that doesn't exist.

10747,gameofthrones,It's not just show watchers. It's people that don't read theories online as well. How many people that read the books once 5+ years ago remember all the details regarding Rhaegar? I'd bet not many.

10773,gameofthrones,"I'm calling it now: after Theon saves Yara on the Iron Islands, they witness the Night King show up and raise all the dead from the sea.  Why?  Because the Ironborn conveniently always toss their dead into the ocean and ""What is dead may never die, but rises again stronger and harder.""  That shit wasn't metaphor, it was prophecy."
10774,gameofthrones,oof
10775,gameofthrones,"Yeah, who knows, they might even work it to their advantage.  Pull a Targaryen and marry within bloodlines, using Jon as the figure head who gets the rest of Westeros to accept the new leadership."
10776,gameofthrones,"Wait, why did Pycelle have to die?"
10777,gameofthrones,"She really hasn't, he may have hated Tyrion, but Cersei was probably his most disappointing child.

""I don't distrust you because you're a woman; I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.""

He at least trusted Tyrion to be hand in his stead, and made him master of Coin."
10778,gameofthrones,Not all of the starks won
10779,gameofthrones,"It's also too obvious. I feel like Arya's killings and the faceless men in general revolve around not seeing it coming as the viewer. That's literally how the faceless men operate, so showing us that Baelish died and then having Arya using his face to kill someone beats the entire point of the faceless men.

This is all from a viewer's perspective btw. Arya can obviously use his face if she wanted, but I highly doubt the directors will use it for aforementioned reasons."

But what I REALLY want to know is, who is this Darth guy in the black mask? He seems to know an awful lot about Luke."
10790,gameofthrones,I don't understand why Jon leaving the NW isn't a bigger deal to the other Northern houses. Unless Jon's sharing his whole death/resurrection story the other lords should be shooing him off back to the wall or calling him an oathbreaker.

A lot of people like what they do. As a result there is a lot of money in what they do.

That is utterly irrelevant to the question of whether or not someone should be paid a living wage and what that wage is. No one person is paying a movie star those millions. We're all kicking in twenty cents because they entertained us for two hours.

Now if only we could convince people to kick in twenty cents to actually help lift people out of this shit-tier gutter we call life maybe we could get somewhere."

At least give him the honor of fighting and losing.


EDIT: okay, let me be clear: I don't mean to say that he *deserved* anything. What I mean is that it comes off as sloppy writing when you repeatedly build up a character as a fearsome warrior, and then kill him off in an instant ambush where he gets stabbed in an area that should be armored."

He says something like ""And the sea is frozen"", which suggests that this is how the NK is going to ""walk"" around East Watch by the Sea and might account for the change in the picture."

10984,gameofthrones,"It would also probably be for safety reasons from a exhaustion standpoint. We have to always keep in mind that actors and actresses have to be out there in those conditions, filming in full costume for days at a time. They usually cannot quickly change out of clothes or put down props too easily since they might be needed at any point. So if they have a choice between Kit running around set for a day with that metal sword or running around with a rubber sword, they’ll pick the rubber one since it’s less likely to hurt him or anyone else, less likely to tire him out, and less likely to cost a bunch to replace if it gets misplaced. 

Besides, unless you specifically look for this, you will typically not notice this and that’s what matters since most of your audience is not going to be the sort of person sitting there rewatching a scene fifty times... it’s the people who will watch once or twice a year typically and are more likely to get caught up in the whole story and characters more than that.

It would also probably be easier from a continuity’s standpoint since it’s easier to keep right there on Kit’s person and thus would be shifting around less from shot to shot. That’s an underrated bit of film making and one of the more exhausting bits."

11000,gameofthrones,"You're probably right about D&D being burnt out. The scene that stood out to me in the new episode was the conversation between Cersei and Jaime, after Jaime gets back to Kings Landing. Here we see them both so vulnerable -- their *second* child just died from poisoning, they no longer have their father's strength or power, and war is clearly resting on the horizon. They've both been through so much, and at this point they only have each other. What a great opportunity! But, ultimately, this scene fell flat for me. Cersei rambles about prophecies and the only thing Jaime can say is ""fuck everyone who isn't us!"" Like really, that's the best you could do? Maybe it fell flat because these two characters really are lost, but even the way they articulated their despair felt...off. Maybe I'm overanalyzing this scene, but it really bothered me. "

11017,gameofthrones,Nothing wrong with being descriptive with a title
11018,gameofthrones,"I totally agree that how Jon feels about being resurrected was completely lost to the action scenes of the last season. It's a shame, really. I still enjoyed what we got, but spending just a little time on that darker side of Jon would have made for richer material. But I guess they gave that existential stuff to Rory for the Hound's scenes at the father and daughter's house, so I can't really complain too much. 

I do hope that its in the text for the finale season. With all of the Starks at home together - especially Bran - there HAS to be some discussion over Jon being brought back to life. Otherwise, its just too strange the way the others accept it. I still feel like Sansa either doesn't really ""get"" it, or she's indulging Jon and doesn't believe her brother was ever really dead. Or maybe he lied to her, too, and fudged his way out of him leaving the NW. We never really got confirmation of that."

11027,gameofthrones,"One of the main complaints about the show was that it was hard to keep track of all the characters. I definitely feel like they had to simplify the plots so it would be easier to follow. They literally killed all the Frey's in the season opener so they no longer have to address that storyline. They simply forgot about Edmure Tully. We only have 6 episodes before everything comes to a conclusion. I am not a fan of the way Season 7 simplified everything, but I understand. "

11121,gameofthrones,Great skillz Op
11122,gameofthrones,I don't understand the rules of this game but I reckon that's not within the rules.
11123,gameofthrones,So obvious this is what Ned did. I do wish he had told Cat tho. 
11124,gameofthrones,"Meanwhile their neighbors, the two Fossoway families, have them beat as far as apple representation goes. Pretty shameful for a house with ""apple"" in their name."
11125,gameofthrones,So... if you get the tickets and need a date I clean up really nice... just sayin... 
11126,gameofthrones,"SHUTUP! I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!"
11127,gameofthrones,"Replica swords you say? 

If I can swing around Ice, I’m leaving right fucking now. "
11128,gameofthrones,Lady Mormont would have been a steal if anyone picked her up. 
11129,gameofthrones,Well she does need an heir now.
11130,gameofthrones,"Nothing against the Starks, but the Bolton's banners would be more fitting for Halloween. "
11131,gameofthrones,R+L=Gay
11132,gameofthrones,"Dany: Give up the throne, or there will be violence.

Cersei: I choose violence.

Dany: dracarys.


"
11133,gameofthrones,What?
11134,gameofthrones,"Looks perfect other than the characters do not get turned into white walkers, they get turned into wights. The undead zombies."
11135,gameofthrones,"You could still add the Childish titels: Defender of the Wall, The raised Again, the Libirator of the North

11139,gameofthrones,Fake it till you make it.
11140,gameofthrones,The difference now is a little more stark. 
11141,gameofthrones,"They should have had benjen come in just before the night king aimed at Drogon, distracting the night king, giving Jon enough time to get back to the others. Then have a cool battle between benjen and a white walker/ the night king himself. Wraps up Benjen, and gets Jon home safe. 
There's no problem really with Benjen being there, we know he's beyond the wall and likely tracking the White Walkers. The problem is the whole Jon falling in the water bit felt forced to allow the Benjen scene. 
Alternatively as someone else said, they could have shown glimpsing of him tracking the seven north of the wall, allowing him to come in when ever. "
11142,gameofthrones,Those twitter replies are worse than YouTube comments. 
11143,gameofthrones,She was really good in 300.
11144,gameofthrones,Damn your neighbors wealthy af
11145,gameofthrones,What else are you going to do with it? Going to wear it to conventions?
11146,gameofthrones,Where the fuck is John snow tho
11147,gameofthrones,"What's it spoiling, that there's a wall?"
11148,gameofthrones,Yep.
11149,gameofthrones,And stunning penalty from the dragon fire +- near-death experience +- entering the water (caught off guard) 
11150,gameofthrones,They had no choice. They ran out of original story because there was none left.

11155,gameofthrones,"ANDDDD later when dany gets off her throne and talks abt being sold like a broodmare and having faith in herself and how shes gonna rule, she says it herself. but when davos lists jons accomplishments to reply DAVOS does it not jon. showing dany is a queen coz she says she is, jons a king coz he was chosen to be. "
11156,gameofthrones,"I'm never going to call him that, he'll always be Jon to me"

11159,gameofthrones,The big red arrow is the true enemy! The White Walkers are a ruse!
11160,gameofthrones,Did the Kaiser take them in nineteen-dickey-two?
11161,gameofthrones,Could be  flashback to the Frey massacre and her escaping.
11162,gameofthrones,The one on the left kinda looks like a corgi. 
11163,gameofthrones,We should start a revolution 
11164,gameofthrones,That officer's name? Detective Copstein.
11165,gameofthrones,"While I certainly appreciate that the whole thing may have been a mess and that Jackson was in a difficult position, this doesn't absolve him from the issue. ""[G]oing on to a set and ... winging it"" is not how you make a movie. And Peter Jackson, of all people, knows this. Going ahead in this manner is an insult to the audience, the fans, the production team, and the source material itself. If he had any respect for Tolkien, then he should have abandoned the project altogether if he knew from day one that the end result was going to be far from perfect. "
11166,gameofthrones,[removed]
11167,gameofthrones,Makes it even better that the actors that play each character don't like each other in real life. Messy past relationship lol
11168,gameofthrones,"Yupp. To design a wildfire cannon you'd have to make steel of sufficient strength and heat tolerance. As we know from the Valyrian Steel blades they did not know how to make it, and only very few knew how to reforge it. 

The truth is that the Maesters guarded knowledge very jealously. The Lords were unwilling to fund science beyond taking on a Maester and any innovation popping up among the blacksmiths was strangled out of existence by the guild system. Without the ability to read, write and distribute information innovation goes very very slowly. The constant fights against the long winters made it economically risky to spend resources on anything other than war and stockpiling supplies."
11169,gameofthrones,Sam and Jon are a close second!
11170,gameofthrones,"For me, I find it hard to believe that Lyanna (although described as willful and stubborn) would continue with Rhaegar even if she loved him. She must have known the damage this could cause to her family, which by all accounts she loved. "
11171,gameofthrones,Inclusion of the Dorne Pokemon would be preferable to the current Dorne storyline.
11172,gameofthrones,Is brienne gay though? Seriously asking

11174,gameofthrones,"You were a kid, with boundless energy.  I used to never want to take a nap when I was young.  Mom had to lay next to me and hold my eyes closed, otherwise, I never would have fallen asleep.  Of course, she enjoyed her naps while us kids were asleep too."
11175,gameofthrones,"The Dothraki, as portrayed in both the show and books, are largely shown to be unarmored berserkers  that mostly win by being ferocious and attacking head on.  That is in contrast to the Huns, who based their armies around horse archers and heavily armed lancers.  You then have the Unsullied who are lightly armored, which is an improvement from the books where they only wear helmets, and wield short spears.  It doesn't matter how hard they are when they would be slaughtered by archers and lancers.  They are basically ancient greek hoplites.  In the books, somehow chariots are still also a valid form of warfare, so I guess the bronze age never ended.  Westerosi knights in a combined army like the golden company should not be just ahead of everyone, they should basically crush everyone in their path. For example, in the real world, the mongols who were much better equipped and led than the dothraki we have seen, got their asses handed to them when they fought such forces in Hungary."
11176,gameofthrones,Be afraid of weddings..... Be very afraid.
11177,gameofthrones,> stark realization
11178,gameofthrones,"not true, he was on his way to being a great king. He got the crown and faith working together, and did away with stupid shit, like trial by combat. He was young, but he chose to not listen to Jamie when he told him he could do anything he wanted as long as he sat on the Throne. It takes a pretty special person to voluntarily relinquish power that can be abused. He even dealt with his family fairly, and without bias. I do think Tywin would have raised him to be a good king, but one that manages a breaking system and doesn't adapt. He was honestly doing better as a king that wanted to do right by the people, instead of using force or wealth to maintain power. After a series of awful kings, you need someone that the people actually have faith in"
11179,gameofthrones,\**The Sigil of Woodstock*
11180,gameofthrones,"Ok, Tina."
11181,gameofthrones,Yup. GRRM confirmed she isn't actually fireproof
11182,gameofthrones,"Illyrio and Jorah both had obvious ulterior motives . . . Barristan was good, but really only so far as military matters were concerned. 

Tyrion may not have the grasp of tactics that Barristan had, but he has some. His real power is his knowledge of actually how to rule/govern."
11183,gameofthrones,Found the IT guy.
11184,gameofthrones,My gf is currently watching the series for the first time. Obviously she loves Dani's story and I am so excited for her to get to this scene. 
11185,gameofthrones,Doggoception.
11186,gameofthrones,"Excelent theory. Also fits well with Jon's struggle with low self-esteem in the books. He keeps all those fears inside in the books... I never thought that was portrayed in the show, not until recently."
11187,gameofthrones,Yup. I'd imagine that comes up again.
11188,gameofthrones,This is amazing! God bless you OP. 
11189,gameofthrones,He can borrow Littlefinger's jetpack.

11191,gameofthrones,"> It's not that I don't want Arya to be completely outsmarting LF in the game that's being run

I don't, it would be absolutely ridiculous. She hasn't done anything that indicates she would be capable of intricate plots and defeating the greatest plotmaster in Westeros.

11198,gameofthrones,You forget you are watching Game of Thrones. The kingdoms exhausted by the war of the five kings are gonna be even more tired by winter and the inevitable war with Jon Snow. They are pretty much doing everything they can for the white walkers.
11199,gameofthrones,What about dead inside? 
11200,gameofthrones,"If this is like any domestic abuse case and codependence, Cersei probably still believes that Jaime will come back running to her."
11201,gameofthrones,"He knows that I am pretty sure, but is how people will look at it, most wouldnt believe he was resurrected and think he deserted."
11202,gameofthrones,I thought about that too but Ser Pounce has shown no desire to rule the seven kingdoms. I assume he will take the black and become the lord commander of the nights watch. 
11203,gameofthrones,And hodor stays healthy in the past. 
11204,gameofthrones,I wanna know too!
11205,gameofthrones,"To be fair, a large number of actors are cast to play some kind of version of themselves.

That's why actors like Gary Oldman who seem cameleon like in their ability to not only play a wide variety of different characters and personalities but to transform their look, mannerisms, accent etc are so lauded. "
11206,gameofthrones,Qyburn called him that at the end of the last season but he has been referenced as being gregor clegane in this season

11211,gameofthrones,"Yeah that was one of my favourite scenes of the season, not just the episode. Felt like a scene we would have seen in season 1 or 2. Her and Peter have a great chemistry, and that back and forth between the characters has been missing from the recent seasons."
11212,gameofthrones,"Reddit:- how did you make this awesome art?

OP:- EXPERIENCE"
11213,gameofthrones,"There's definitely some penetration involved, either way. "
11214,gameofthrones,It did cost £65 but definitely worth it as a memento! 
11215,gameofthrones,"It's a very Bronn thing, though. As he explained, if Cersei goes all Sept of Baelor on everyone, he's going to claim credit for setting it up. On the other hand, if Dany has Drogon roast everyone present, he's not volunteering to be a charcoal briquette.

Basically, he knew this meeting was going to probably end very badly and there was no upside in being there for it."
11216,gameofthrones,Ohh! That's why he made that face. He is totally is in the same position Mance was in. I love coming here after the show. Enlightening.

11219,gameofthrones,"you can see all of this, and very much want to believe it... but it was just last season we all thought the same thing. I get that this time around it is a more plausible scenario.

Still doesn't change the fact that last time we thought she was one step ahead she was not. So that adds some skepticism. 

If it turns out that they were planning it all along, so I would feel this exact way, then bravo D&D. "

11250,gameofthrones,Cersei sent him a crow saying her servants aren't home.
11251,gameofthrones,"> looting the loot train, and dragging it all the way back to Dragonstone would leave them in the same vulnerable position the Lannister army was.

Literally impossible when you have 3 dragons that can just circle overhead and torch any advancing forces that try to retake the loot."
11252,gameofthrones,"Live in York, took a pic of this too today. As I was telling my mum who it was, she said ""I thought it was the guy from Star Wars""

"
11261,gameofthrones,"Exactly. I somewhat liked Arya before that, but after that arc I hate her character. Maise is good enough, but...come on. The way she acts - Arya, not Maise, is just dumb. The fight with Sansa the cold blooded way she kills LF and so on. She is a psychopath, she murdered an entire house (Freys) because Walder was a cunt. 

The entire time she was getting wreck by the Waif and then out of nowhere she kills her WHILE BLEEDING. 

It's shock value. Writing in the past few seasons was very weak. "

11278,gameofthrones,Stupid 2 year old GoT fans with wrong swords and shit
11279,gameofthrones,"Yes, it's quite odd that JQ just let her go with a nod.  It seemed clear to me that JQ did not care whether Ayra or the Waif triumphed.  He was passive when he sent the waif, and he was passive when Arya showed up.  If anything,  the evidence seems to indicate he preferred Arya (giving her a pass on a pretty substantial earlier screw up, training with blindness, commenting that a girl had many gifts).   

I wonder if the faceless men expect her to return in some capacity or expect her to do exactly what she's doing.   You would think they would frown upon a rogue agent out there using their skillset to assassinate people out of a personal agenda.  Maybe we'll see more in the books.   "
11280,gameofthrones,Tywin even looks like in the books!
11281,gameofthrones,"and then he decided to make it insanely huge, about the size of south america... which makes it hard to believe that the kingdoms would all speak the same language in a medieval setting."
11282,gameofthrones,"I'll do my best to summarize...

Son is turning 5, Dad asks him what he wants for his birthday.  Son thinks about it for a minute and asks for a white golf ball.  Dad shrugs, agrees, and gifts him a white golf ball.

Son is turning 6, Dad asks him what he wants for his birthday.  Son thinks about it for a minute and asks for a green golf ball.  Dad shrugs, agrees, and gifts him a green golf ball.

Son is turning 7, Dad asks him what he wants for his birthday.  Son thinks about it for a minute and asks for a red golf ball.  Dad shrugs, agrees, and gifts him a red golf ball.

And you do as many birthdays and you can get away with, or add in graduation, marriage, anniversaries, etc. until the person you're telling the joke is ready to punch you in the face.  (I've literally run out of colors to use by keeping it going for so long.)

Then you switch it up...

One day, the son gets into a car accident.  His condition is critical and his Dad races to the hospital.  The doctor tells him that he could pass at any moment.

Dad takes his Son's hand.  Son stirs a little.  Dad says, ""Son, before you pass, I just have to ask you one question, then you can shut your eyes forever.""  

Son nods.  Dad asks, ""What was with all the golfballs?""  

The Son motions weakly for him to come closer.  Dad leans in, Son inhales, starts to speak...and dies."
11283,gameofthrones,"Nobody was supposed to empathize with him. If you read his character in the book, he’s even more sadistic. As bad as Theon’s torture and his treatment of Sansa in the show was, what he does to Theon in the books and how he treats Jeyne Pool is absolutely terrible. The character has no redeeming qualities. I think he’s supposed to represent the worst of humanity. He was a fucked up kid who was raised by a fucked up human (the original Reek). He forced a lady to marry him for her castle and then locked her in a dungeon where she starved to death. When they find her body, they find that she ended up eating her own fingers because she was so desperate and hungry. Show Ramsay is more reserved imo. "
11284,gameofthrones,Please tell me I can buy this somewhere

so, people are expecting this to happen...

people also seem to forget that if anything Martin doesn't do tropes, he deconstructs them

he will probably try to rape her at some point and get killed or something in that regard

or she will fall for him only for him to die horribly

or for her to die horribly

The guy never said that GRRM isn't a good writer and that he only uses basic techniques. 

Just that this one line is hardly as impressive as it is being made out to be by some people. Its just an ""in joke"" for people who know what is happening. Its not supposed to actually convey anything to the reader. If it did, that would spoil the red wedding which is where the actual writing shines.

One could argue that when she become Queen of Meereen she is attempting to be a peacetime ruler rather than a conquerer.

It's the exact opposite way around: If Tywin would have treated Tyrion with respect to begin with, he would not seek refuge in addictions that much.

> He probably treats Tyrion harshly because he subconsciously blames him for his wifes death, albeit not as overtly as Cersei does.

No shit. The point is that that's not an excuse. Quite the opposite, in fact.

> Cersei is a woman and Tywin only really sees her as a political tool, not as an heir.

He sees everyone as a political tool.

There is also the fact that he had Tyrions first love gang raped and that he completely eradicated house Castamere, but okay.

By the time I got there to start prepping stuff for the wedding they looked like they had come from a wooden crate that had been on a fishing boat for years.

11519,gameofthrones,"It's a complex scene that's really well done.

There's a touch of pity and forgiveness on her face mixed with a bit of Batman-esque ""[I won't kill you but I don't have to save you, either](https://youtu.be/EJCxgt7Qb6k?t=13)"".

Arya, like The Hound, is burdened with a sliver of conscience."

11521,gameofthrones,"I agree with this. But then would most people be satisfied with it looking 'just similar?' There are viewers who expect things to be spot on look-a-likes to the books - whether it's castles or characters. 
Even if it _was_ the same, there's probably always something to criticise heavily about. 
I mean just take this recent example - Rhaegar looked very similar to his book description, and people were _still_ disappointed because he didn't exactly match the way they imagined him to be. Now just put castles in place of Rhaegar and it's pretty much the same. "

11537,gameofthrones,"I don't think it's impossible that you're right, I just don't see Tywin leaving a prisoner of great importance with someone like the Mountain, he knew the mountain wasn't smart. I would assume he would have arranged to take her to King's Landing, but assuming you're right, maybe he had some kind of plan for her that got interrupted by him seeing an attack available on Robb. It's likely you could be right though, or at least I can see where you are coming from."

11579,gameofthrones,"Off the cuff, she seemed willing to risk war with Dorne just to get Myrcella out of the clutches of the Dornish given that mission she sent Jaime and Bronn on, and she was definitely distraught over Myrcella's death, both in the scene between her and Jaime, and when she confronted Ellaria later. She was also about to commit suicide with Tommen during the Battle of the Blackwater to spare Tommen from dying at Stannis's hands potentially."

When Tyrion wants him against the Mountain, he says fuck no. He's more practical than that and isn't overconfident, he knows his bounds and we see him continue fighting when he knows he's confident.

This is the first time we really see him terrified and it shows. Amazing work by everyone involved in the show."

It got to the point where one of the female characters straight up tells the male character ""I want a man who does [X], not [Y]"" with no equivocation.

Not more than  a few chapters later, male character essentially does [Y] almost exactly as described, to which the female gets justifiably upset, and then the male *goes off on a mopey rant about how he has no idea how to understand females,* despite the fact that he was explicitly told how to act in that situation and massively failed to do so.

11678,gameofthrones,"Teddy, respectfully, I disagree with you on Book Cersei not being a sympathetic villain but maybe it's a matter of opinion.  A big underlying theme is the abuse she faced from powerful men in her past, and while her hatred seethes for guys like Tywin and Robert, she cannot help emulating them however badly it ends for her.

&#x200B;

* ASOIF clearly showcases Robs alcoholism and how his incessant drinking (and unresolved grief for Lyanna) leads to him physically abusing Cersei.  As the books progress and Cersei accumulates power, Martin showcases a mirror of Cersei drinking wine and gaining weight in later books.  Presumably she's self medicating via some good ole Highgarden vino to ward off the stresses of ""ruling"" in Kings Landing, just like Rob did.

&#x200B;

* Cersei also has a mixture of resentment and awe of her father as well.  Resentment for her perceived abuse when she was younger through forced marriages for familial alliances, as well as his preference for a male heir progeny (rather than her).  While she hates the ""exploitation"" her father put her through to further his goals and that of Casterly Rock, she shown to clearly emulate--however badly--his political machinations and Machiavellian scheming.  

&#x200B;

* I might be reading too deep but I feel like Martin somewhat portrays Cersei as an antagonist worth pitying rather than hating.  Playing Westerosi armchair psychologist, Cersei's quest to win the Game of Thrones is largely a sad endeavor and one that she actually does not want.  Her ultimate goal to win the throne is not for herself, but rather out of insecurity and revenge.  It's one driven to prove to those men that have abused and used her that she is not a simple doe-eyed, blond haired princess.

11686,gameofthrones,I was thinking about the books. I vaguely remember  Beric Dondarion saying that. The only reason Thoros was able to bring him back was because he had unfinished business. Which leads to Cat becoming Lady Stoneheart to get revenge on the Freys.

People assume that ""the artist painted the walls black because he thought that was cool."" Which, in and of itself, isn't incorrect. Oftentimes artists will deliberately state that they just ""do things for the heck of it.""

The question to ask is... why? What caused the artist to think that the color black fit the scene that they created? Are they trying to convey something about a character, or perhaps the setting itself? Usually, if you ask enough questions, the *actual* answer is more than just ""because I wanted to.""

The 4th book came out in 2005, when high production TV shows were only beginning to become a thing. With the raising popularity of the book series, now being read by lots of people who are not only hard core fantasy fans, the hype around number 5 coming out in 2011 was insanely high for a book. That's when the TV show came out as well and for a good reason. If the TV show didn't get made, he would definitely be less rich and won't be interviewed as much, but he would still be very famous for an author. However with how popular the books had already gotten and how suitable they are for an epic screen production, it was practically unavoidable. "

11812,gameofthrones,"In my opinion the plot has just gotten too large for them to handle. They don't know what to do next, and are trying to pick up storylines they haven't bothered touching for 3 seasons. 

This results in generalizations. Instead of introducing the dornish names proper for Sunspear and other various Dorne locations, they try to think what show watchers would think. ""Where's that guy Oberyn from again, we are following his girlfriend around now??"" ""Oh yeah, he  was from Dorne! That must be what this palace place is""

It's simply too massive now for the show to accurately portray. The should consider themselves lucky that some people even remembered who Benjen was. "

11904,gameofthrones,"Where is it said that they *have* to film at a real site? Even if that is true, you're wrong that they couldn't integrate whatever they film into an otherwise-all-CG set.

Go look up some of those TV show CG compilations. There do shots on real sites all the time and then essentially cut-and-paste the actors and immediate surroundings into much more elaborate digital sets. They could have easily done so with this location if they absolutely ""had"" to film at the place they chose.

Whatever reason there is for not doing so, it wasn't because they *couldn't* do it. "

The **Hype** is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing to his brother, which eventually, of course, he will. Unfortunately, he taught his brother everything he knew, then his brother killed him in AN EPIC, EPISODE-LONG BATTLE. Ironic. He could save Cersei from death, but not himself."
11942,gameofthrones,"That’s a good question, and the answer is probably simple and probably has something to do with their solar/lunar calendar, which seems to be similar to ours. Real life civilizations had established solar calendars way back when. 
Also, I believe the maesters are all versed in astronomy, so they probably figured it out a long time ago. 

Edit: another thing - I don’t think we know that the seasons affect Essos like they do Westeros, so there are likely some areas of Planetos that wouldn’t be able to rely on the seasons either way "

Then she shows up to the slavers attacking the city.

I dont see her keeping Tyrion by her side anymore. It doesnt look very good

Edit: Tyrion didnt directly kill any of her family but in their world being a part of that family is usually just as bad."
11954,gameofthrones,"I strongly disagree, actually. I found Ramsay to be one of the weakest characters *Game of Thrones* has ever offered. Making a villain evil for the sake of being evil seems very out of line with GoT’s core philosophy: no good guys, no bad guys, just survivors. And if you start to become the good guy, then you stop being a survivor. Everyone should be complex and audiences should see things from their points of view every now and then.

Ramsey was just a sociopath. Who’s going to empathize with a sociopath? "

Edit: seems I'm a little off on the timeline. 

Tower of Joy DID come after Kings landing and Storms End. 

Ned returning Dawn to Starfall and the assault on Dragonstone was after. We would get to see young Viserys and newborn Dany being smuggled out of Westeros in the final scene. "

I think if I crochet'd (is that how you spell it? Crocheyed? How do I say this in the past tense?) It might make it a bit more worth it, because they'd have a nice blanket or sweater after I was done, whereas a cross stitch is a display piece, and usually a small one at that."

The crux of the disagreement is the politicization of very specific kinds of trauma.

Lots of poor people are working their ass off in an office, service, labor, or other kind of job. They're poor because they got unlucky and got sick or injured or love someone sick/injured and the medical bills don't pay themselves.

Even people who work at McDonald's arent all just dumb teens working because they're too lazy to do anything else. 50% of all McDonald's workers are middle aged iirc. Walk into any McDonald's and looks t the staff and ask yourself why 30+ year olds are working there. Ask yourself if you'd want to work there if you were 30.

Here's an anecdote. I personally know a family where both parents work at McDonald's. They're from South America and were both surgeons but got the fuck out when their country tanked. Not everyone older working at McDonald's used to be a surgeon, obviously, but think twice about being dismissive over someone's job."

12106,gameofthrones,"On top of that lying about Euron.  There is no way Cersei told Euron to lie about going to the iron islands because she had no idea what was going to happen during this peace talk.

I think she got to him hefore he left and told him her plan.  Then told Jamie only half the story so that he'd feel small and insecure."

12115,gameofthrones,"Is that why the season premiere didn't even get a 9 on IMDB? These scores are a great indicator of how much people liked each episode. Sure, all the episodes are rated highly, but there is still a range. Bad episodes get usually a little over 8 (with some even less I think), while good ones get high scores. To say that this information is meaningless is just dumb."

He’s literally doing that exact thing right now in the books. Sitting around freezing and starving while his armies drops like flies. He may have a secret plan, but who even knows if it will work. He could totally end up dying a useless death. "

Then he goes on to tell his sister that her brother was secretly watching her lose her virginity.... ಠ_ಠ"

12177,gameofthrones,Yeah the fact that Cersei suddenly stopped being crazy and let Tyrion survive even if she know he is in the town sounds very weird.  Both Cersei and Danny seem to not really going mad. I am disappointed I wanted them going full force at each others throats. Now it seem this series may end just with peace between everyone or something pretty much based on nothing. 
12178,gameofthrones,TIMMYYYYYYYYY
12179,gameofthrones,Is a Golf Resort in Ireland going to be forced to take it down? xp
12180,gameofthrones,"Ok, so:

* Helping the son of the wealthiest man on the continent when his life is on the line, after being promised a reward and excellent work prospects, is selfless?
* Playing defensively is not the problem, I remember Bronn using tricks like pushing a statue over his opponent to gain an edge. Usually tournament fights are held in uncluttered areas to prevent this. 

* We kinda need our limbs intact to live, so I don't know where this non vital spot rumor was born. If a surgeon with a scalpel slips and cuts you in the wrong spot, the entire operation is jeopardised and extra measures are to be taken to prevent harm. A longsword going through your thigh, where major blood vessels are located, is supposed to be safe? Not even taking infections into account, in a world where blood transfer doesn't exist, a lot of juice leaving your body is going to kill you. In a documented duel (in the same setting in real life France) one of the contestants died in the arena after he got whisked behind the knee with a small knife. Bronn meant to kill the man, it just happens that the back of his leg wasn't covered with plate (there were combat manuals focused extensively on hitting this point).

I think this is spinning the narrative to make Bronn look like a honorable character that is misunderstood. It does nothing else but diminishes his characterization. "
12181,gameofthrones,r/uglyduckling
12182,gameofthrones,"But she is pregnant though right? Or is she lying to keep Jamie in line, play Tyrian etc?"
12183,gameofthrones,"The book *Fire and Blood* actually goes into it a bit. Balerion ended up dying at something over 200 years old, but the last person to ride him, Viserys I (at the time still just a prince) basically stated that Balerion didn't have the strength to make from King's Landing to Dragonstone.

Now, part of that may be due to what happened to Balerion 40 years before he died, in 54 AC. One of Jahaerys's nieces, Aerea Targaryen, tried to claim Balerion. They flew off, and weren't seen for almost two years, until the Black Dread returned in 56 AC, wounded and scarred, with Aerea on his back, horribly injured and barely alive. She died that night, Balerion never fully recovered. Balerion entered the Dragonpit for the first time upon his return, and from that point on he basically woke only to eat before falling asleep again for months at a time.

At some point, the power of magic needed to sustain a dragon is insufficient to overcome the square-cube law. Yes, I know, bringing in physics and biology to a fantasy universe that features undead and flying, fire-breathing dinosaurs is silly, but as far as I can tell GRRM does write in the whole ""power at a price"" element of magic, and so for a dragon, growing too large eventually brings it to a point where the additional power that comes from its innate magic is simply insufficient to overcome the physical exertion needed for such a being to move.

But for those 200 years, during which time such a beast is all flame, fury, and ferocity, yeah, seeing that opposite you on the battlefield is going to cause you a severe looseness in the bowels."
12184,gameofthrones,You probably got him confused with someone else. Ilyn Payne's tongue was cut out by the Mad King; he doesn't talk.

12191,gameofthrones,">fur is very very very hard to animate

Well, true. Look how long it took to make Monsters Inc. "
12192,gameofthrones,"That was one of my favorite moments, but they also didn't drag it out.  Daenerys has one scene where Barristan and Jorah question her actions, and then Drogon sounds plaintive for about 15 seconds before the big reveal, but that's it.

In this case, the *only* interactions between Sansa and Arya that we know of are antagonistic.  If the showrunners are making the point that the Starks have changed and they have to get to know one another again, this bait-and-switch that will presumably get resolved in one thrilling 45-second scene is gonna do nothing to show *how* Sansa and Arya grow to be close again, how their new personalities interact with each other, etc.  I would have preferred 3 episodes of that rather than this trick which might make for a single flashy scene, but no character development.  That character development wasn't necessary in Dany's case because we already had ample information about her relationships with her dragons and her advisers."
12193,gameofthrones,"You aren't crazy. The writing and shit is weaker since there are no books to go by. Things are a lot more simplified as well. But meh, I just want to see who wins now "
12194,gameofthrones,"i'm shipping a Bronn, Jaime, frey love triangle.

12195,gameofthrones,"Daario got the chance to sleep with Dany, Jorah haven't got it yet even though he's (probably) the first Westerosi to follow Dany in her journey (even though his goal is to spy on her at first)"
12196,gameofthrones,Seriously did he just plan out every single detail of the story and then write it? Because the fact that things which occur in the later books are alluded to in books written 20 years ago is astounding.

12232,gameofthrones,"The game of thrones music is actually really good! I mean, there’s the awesome intro song of course, but the background music is great too. Every place in GoT has their own theme music, which allows them to also use music as a foreshadowing tool in the episodes.

12255,gameofthrones,"Surprisingly, Peter Dinklage said no when they offered to remove his nose completely."
12256,gameofthrones,The reason I don't like this battle is the lead up to it was played exactly as Sansa said it would. John doesn't wait for anyone to return their help and tries to go at it severely outnumbered and nearly get 99% of his guys killed until the actions of his sister saved them. Only successful part of Johns strategy was he drew out all the forces for the Erie calvary to destroy and prevented a siege by losing his only giant in the process.

That puts him next..Even before Samwell's sisters. He is the next Male heir, bastard or not. That means Little Sam, Crasters incest boy child, is next in line. Sam's farther would shit himself, but the succession is clear. Nearest male heir comes before any female in line. That would make Gilly...The next Lady of Horn Hill.

Littlefinger. Ramsay. She's not a little naive girl anymore. At this point, I doubt she actually cares about family anymore. Look how fast she was to give up on Rickon just to get a bigger army, an army that she knew she could get, but never divulged to Jon after berating him for two episodes about how small the army they got was. She has become a manipulator. "
12370,gameofthrones,"IRL Maisie is quite pretty. She’s not a glamour puss like  some others, but the show has deliberately kept her dowdy looking. And last year’s Ned=do was her worst hair since Braavos. Maybe they’ll soften her appearance now that she’s finally home and there’s a hairdresser "
12371,gameofthrones,"The scene that impacted me the most in this show was Roz tied to Jofferys bed with all those bolts sticking out of her.

She just wanted a better life for herself, and that's how it ended up.  What a cold awful world.

That scene, for me was worse than Oberyn, it just stuck with me and haunted my dreams, the amount of pain and terror she must have gone through before dying, absolutely brutal and horrible.

That being said I like the show BECAUSE it can make me feel that way, because it impacts me so deeply, it's just so good.

This past season, sadly has left me a bit dissapointed with the writing."

12440,gameofthrones,">if you have a very stirner\-esque view of ethics he's doing the right thing.

For people that don't know what's up, Griffith is a character from a long\-running Dark Fantasy japanese serial graphic novel.

Griffith:

* Seduces pedophilic royalty to raise the funds to build an army.
* Engages in pitched battles as a mercenary regularly where young warriors lose their lives.
* Commits political assassination through the work of others in order to better secure his newfound position as a low\-born lord. Including permitting the murder of a child.
* Rapes a naive/underage crown princess to usurp the throne.
* Sacrifices his entire mercenary band to demons in order to be resurrected as a demon.
* Rapes another woman out of spite for her lover.
* Enlists demons to subjugate the countryside.
* Allows his lieutenants to flay, torture, rape, and cannibalize human beings with impunity.
* Allows the entire world to be redesigned to fit his whims, which essentially results in the death and enhanced suffering of millions of innocent people.
* Is pretty.

Anybody actually arguing that Griffith is a morally defensible character is obviously trolling. Hell, the entire point of the protagonist, Guts, is that even when compared to Griffith, he's still a complete monster. If you read Berserk for moral philosophy or to find a good guy who does good things and to whom good things happen... You are in the wrong canon."

12511,gameofthrones,"I believe Boromir is a complex character that's hard to categorize strictly as a traitor or hero. Much like Ned. For example, Ned left Cat her whole life to believe he had a bastard. Which some might argue had a deep negative influence on her."

Jon doesn't want that place at all, as compared to Dany who wants it entirely, or the Stark girls who want only revenge, etc.  Regardless, they all have to pay the cost of power in one form or another.

Then maybe NK has a relationship to the Stark's, and Winterfell, or is Bran as many believe. The Night King would bypass Winterfell, and make King's Landing his invasion focal point. Especially if Winterfell was built with the same magic, and technology as the Wall. Remember the Wall, Winterfell, and the Citadel(which base is made of that black rock) were all built by the same Bran the builder. Also why must a Stark alway's remain at Winterfell. I believe that family mantra was started by Bran the builder for a reason. O.k. I'm taking off my tinfoil hat now."

12665,gameofthrones,Sir. 
12666,gameofthrones,"This kind of fort is a pretty good design actually. It leaves no part of the castle/fort undefended and if someone attacks one arm, you can defend from the arm next to it. 

And regarding trebuchets and cannons, you could put both on the arms and due to the height difference, they would out range the opposition's trebs and cannons (unless they got bigger guns, but that also means the entire army moves slower, while bigger guns on a fort means you can't really aim it as fast at incoming enemies).

And since the enemy would need ships to get there, you could get pretty accurate shots against them while they sway in the waves (ships would have to be of a decent size to carry powerful trebuchets to break down the walls, meaning they are bigger targets for the defending trebuchets and can be sunk).

This kind of fort is pretty damn useful and even common for strategic areas, although the arms are narrower than they would be on most star/bastion forts.

And seeing how this was the foothold of the Targaryen invasion, it would make sense they wanted it to be well defended in order to bring more outside help. 

In short, useful design and well defendable. More defendable than most Westerosi castles. Especially Winterfell, which can be attacked from all sides and has no rivers to protect it. Most other castles are in strategic areas, near cliffs or rivers, with only a couple fronts, meaning fewer men can defend it, meaning less food and money is used. Winterfell is there because Bran the Builder had enough of marching and decided that place would be good enough before going to build The Wall. Although it does contain hot springs, which may have been a determining factor for him regarding winters.

A lizard with six legs is impractical, and the ones shown seem like a alligator or monitor lizard, which means insect-like locomotion is out of the question.

12713,gameofthrones,"Hey, just to be clear, this [subreddit's spoiler guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide) outlines some things that are mainstream enough that they don't need to be tagged. In this case it would be:

&gt;Dany marries Drogo, becomes Khaleesi, and Jorah pledges to follow her

&gt;Dany does not stay married to Drogo, and may marry someone in the future

&gt;There are eventually dragons alive again in the world
Dany is raising the dragons; she is called the ""Mother of Dragons"""
12714,gameofthrones,Remember the last time we overestimated Arya?

12718,gameofthrones,"Weiss directed the season four premiere “Two Swords,” as well, which had that badass tavern fight between the Lannister soldiers and Arya and The Hound. I think five will have the biggest battle, but six will likely have a hefty chunk of action, too. Maybe Night’s King is defeated in 5, then they have to deal with Cersei in 6?"

12752,gameofthrones,Yeah. That kind of puts my Lannister wine glasses to shame. 
12753,gameofthrones,"Well, at first Dany and Drogo's sex scenes were basically rapes. Tommen's sex scenes were comedic because he had so much fun, it was tiring Margaery out. It isn't a double standard. Showing a ~30 year old raping a 14 year old is worse than showing a 16 year old have consensual sex with a ~25 year old. "

12757,gameofthrones,Hes there as jaquen
12758,gameofthrones,The other scene that was so funny is when Toromund is eating some sort of roast and staring down Brienne like he is eating her. Brienne looks horrified and confused at the same time. The eyes on Edd as he witnesses it all! My husband and I saw it again last night and were just roaring with laughter. Little moments like this get forgotten and then you see them again and it surprises you.

12772,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I agree, but whether or not (and to what degree) Arya winds up involved could keep things interesting. Particularly if *a certain* character makes an appearance next season. "

12782,gameofthrones,"That wasn't exactly a happy ending. [spoilers] There's two problems with the ending. One is that the couple's existence is at the mercy of some corporation which can shut them off at anytime or alter their reality in anyway that want (like into some kind of torture Christmas room, for instance). Another issue is that the woman who had to make the choice basically betrayed her family for hedonism with a random girl she slept with on the internet. If the afterlife did exist, she's possibly never going to see her daughter or her beloved husband now. "
12783,gameofthrones,"Cersei is crazy and goes the furthest, doesn't mean she is smart at all. She made blunders for the first 5 seasons and all of a sudden, the writers decide it's time for her to level up smh. 

I actually like evil Cersei, but the fact that they gave her those early victories this season with OP Euron who also has teleportation powers is a little cheap. 

They should have found better ways to reduce Dany's huge advantage instead of doing things for plot convenience time and again. 

I know Tyrion isn't a military mind, but they have made him look rather foolish in Mereen and now back in Westeros. 

This was the man responsible for the next level thinking in blackwater. He and Varys are levels beyond Cersei at the game. "

12787,gameofthrones,^^^^hype
12788,gameofthrones,Given the apocalyptic circumstances I think they might be willing to make an exception. Either have a bastard competent leader or a child with psychic powers but poor judgment and then you become wights
12789,gameofthrones,"He's been dead for about seven years in the books now. If I recall correctly, that is. It's been so long I hardly remember anymore."
12790,gameofthrones,"and this is a gold analysis. You know, We get to see a lot of text posts such as theories/predictions, plot holes, jokes, etc. But very few of well-thought and deep analysis about a character and character development such as this one.

12811,gameofthrones,"I've agreed with that sentiment all along...until last night.  That was some straight up tomfuckery.  Zero indication on how long they were supposed to be sitting on that rock surrounded by the army of the dead.  To the watcher it could have been a few hours.  Obviously it was several days, but to us the viewer it came off very poorly.

They could have addressed that very easily.  Maybe put the army at a distance and closing on them.  That way maybe Dany gets the raven before they're even upon them.  Nope, they went full idiocy and had all this happen in what looked to be damn near real time.  The rest of the fast travel I don't even notice.  It's not important if nothing important happens on their travels.  That one last night was just so poorly done."

12830,gameofthrones,"I'm not defending Tywin because of charisma.  I'm just saying that he has different priorities.

Nobody treats Tyrion with respect.  His drinking and whoring is certainly a coping mechanism, but he still would have had more respect from Tywin if he put forth a more noble image.  Tywin would respect that more.

If your kid was born and it killed your wife, you would absolutely resent that kid.  Nowadays we have therapists and psychologists to help people get past those resentments.  Tywin did not.

Everyone's a political tool for the house, but it doesn't mean he's heartless.

The gang rape was awful, but the Lannisters were rich, remember that.  He was teaching Tyrion a lesson that marriage for love when your in a Lannisters position could just be someone trying to get money.

He saw marriage as a political tool."

12878,gameofthrones,"True to reality, sociopaths exist among 'survivors' and Ramsay certainly had a tragic backstory, a shitty father, and he was always looking for credibility.

12889,gameofthrones,"A lot of people say that and I can understand. But I do feel that adapting the big scene in that episode is one of the biggest challenges the showrunners have faced. A lot of things could've gone wrong in the execution but I feel the showrunners and the director got it just right. The character interactions, dialogue, camera work, ambiguity and overall growing tension of the final scene was perfect as a TV adaptation in my opinion and I could tell that DnD were passionate about doing the Red Wedding from the books justice. I wish I could say the same about the Dragon Pit scene last season."

12898,gameofthrones,"Eeh, at least Skyler's motives made sense. She wasn't buying any of Walter's shit yet she also didn't know the full extent of Walter's problems. Complex situation dealt with realistically. The Sand Snakes are just short-sighted selfish morons. "
12899,gameofthrones,How this really reads is that Lyanna is trying to compensate for the reputation of the house that Jorah left it in.  
12900,gameofthrones,And Ned was going to tell Jon if he didn't get executed.
12901,gameofthrones,I don't think Arya was worried about if they were all guilty. She was there to make a point. It's a warning to all future families to never do a guest harm again or your entire family pays the price.
12902,gameofthrones,Oh my god stoooooop. Why do you hurt us this way?
12903,gameofthrones,"Shouldn't there be sprawling cities/towns around most of these. Like the Twins isn't just going to be two keeps, it's going to have an entire population around it. "
12904,gameofthrones,"No crazier than what the show pulled off with Hodor, honestly. And this won't even require the emotional resonance that scene had. "
12905,gameofthrones,It's a DC show made for free to air networks. Of course it is trash. 
12906,gameofthrones,"IMO the difference is that Joffrey was cruel in a childish way (because, you know, he was a kid), whereas Cersei's actions are calculated. An immature, uncontrolled ruler is way more frustrating and less compelling than one who is a master of the game."
12907,gameofthrones,This is my wish. 
12908,gameofthrones,That detail on the sword is ridiculous.
12909,gameofthrones,What about Sansa was smart besides arguable that final move last season? Genuinely curious. 
12910,gameofthrones,What did he cook?
12911,gameofthrones,Listen. Cherish your Grandmother. This is a dying art and she just went OG on all of us crafty people. 
12912,gameofthrones,The Igles! 
12913,gameofthrones,In Jon's family that's a positive.
12914,gameofthrones,Lancel Lannister.... Gods what a stupid name﻿
12915,gameofthrones,"Arya is a killing machine.

Dragons are killing machines.

The expression is basically one professional admiring another professional."
12916,gameofthrones,HA HA HA HA HA!
12917,gameofthrones,[removed]
12918,gameofthrones,This needs to be made into a buffering icon. 
12919,gameofthrones,What was she expecting? That everyone just bend over for her? Childish expectations.
12920,gameofthrones,Hmm Budlight is the water... I see what you did there.
12921,gameofthrones,"Adorable dogs, but they look nothing like wolves."
12922,gameofthrones,"Balerion always reminded me from the huge-ass dragons in the HTTYD movies. Though I must say he is reminiscent of the Red Death/Green Death in the books as well. I would shit my pants if I saw a dragon that massive on the battlefield though, regardless if I was The Mountain or just little Reek"
12923,gameofthrones,Biter liked it.
12924,gameofthrones,"Isn't it based on a really old and skewed map of Eurasia?

12927,gameofthrones,"Well, that's not nice."
12928,gameofthrones,You can look at my history. :)   
12929,gameofthrones,"Oh right, i forgot about Locke. He was a prisoner in Dorne as well, so 4th?"
12930,gameofthrones,TIL Mario's plumbing portals are called warp pipes.
12931,gameofthrones,You can tell because she's staring at a distance past the camera as if she can't see the camera man
12932,gameofthrones,"🙈Arya had the same smile entering Riverrun, thinking she was reuniting with her family gah..."
12933,gameofthrones,"i don't think the supposed ""best season ever"" can have an episode 8 like the episode 8 we just endured.  

if your kids gets all Bs, you're pretty happy.

if your kid gets three As and one F, you are wondering what the fuck is going on."
12934,gameofthrones,"Looks amazing! You can recognize all the houses from their castle alone, really cool! "
12935,gameofthrones,like a father loves his son
12936,gameofthrones,The wigmaker must have been busy in season 4.
12937,gameofthrones,obviously this one with the black umbrella is photoshopped
12938,gameofthrones,Ehhh
12939,gameofthrones,"I probably haven't been giving him enough attention, but what has the show done to give him more depth? I felt like they weren't using him enough to flush out a character, other than that he's loyal to Jon"
12940,gameofthrones,I think ancestors means the first men battling the darkness together. 
12941,gameofthrones,Thanks for including the smaller houses!
12942,gameofthrones,[deleted]
12943,gameofthrones,It was so obvious he was coming back to life though in that scene. 
12944,gameofthrones,"He can also see Sansa's backing of LF in the Vale and cooperation in the murder of her Aunt. Not enough people bring this up when talking about Sansa: She's just as ""cold-blooded"" as Arya. They both enjoyed watching their victims suffer and die. 

I just don't think he cares anymore - when you can see everything, very little small things matter."
12945,gameofthrones,It was still very rapey. It was just less pedo-ish. 
12946,gameofthrones,"Nah, he should be promoted to Dumber Cunt"
12947,gameofthrones,*hoping for Jearimy Bearimy* YES!
12948,gameofthrones,LF dude looks more like the show's Gendry. Just saying.
12949,gameofthrones,Not a lot of (any?) solo piano in GoT. 
12950,gameofthrones,"Sansa was given to Roose by Baelish to wed Ramsay whom was coming from The Eyrie, Sansa's cousin is the head of the Eyrie, and House Arryn. How *DIDN'T* Ramsay put 2 and 2 together, did he think the Vale wouldn't be a problem? If so, why? Did he not assume Sansa's cousin, and the man who delivered Sansa to himself would let him get away with slaughtering her? Did he not think she would send for help?"
12951,gameofthrones,*Dragon* 2Y Banana.
12952,gameofthrones,"I met him a few weeks ago at Dutch Comic Con and got a picture with him, worth every cent"
12953,gameofthrones,"The voice acting of Jon as well, even if it's just the two lines"
12954,gameofthrones,I’d buy it without a second thought. 
12955,gameofthrones,"> 50% for Jaime and Cersei

It's higher for Jaime and Cersei because their parents were first-cousins. "
12956,gameofthrones,So we really have Randyll to thank for getting his dick wet a couple times
12957,gameofthrones,All her Jorah jokes have been amazing. First the I was petrified song now pretending to be rocks
12958,gameofthrones,You're prettier than both my daughters.
12959,gameofthrones,"So roughly the size of the Arch in St. Louis.

Big, but definitely not as big as I expected. Then again, if we lived in medieval times, 700 feet would be FUCKING HUGE."
12960,gameofthrones,Sounds like a highly reviewed modern American restaurant. Delicious. 
12961,gameofthrones,Dump her.
12962,gameofthrones,"ABsolutely amazing, God bless <3 Hail Satan <3"
12963,gameofthrones,"Bah. I mean... well done the costume, but.. why those two utter arseholes? "
12964,gameofthrones,"Holy fuck got tears in my eyes at the epicness of when the dragons showed up to lay waste, and that was even before the Night King sniped one of them down. A swing of emotions right there"
12965,gameofthrones,"I think Shae genuinely did love Tyrion, book readers may have evidence against my opinion here but from what I saw Shae was incredibly hurt by Tyrions ""rejection"" and incredibly jealous of Sansa when she thought Tyrion loved her instead. She was hurt that badly that she was willing to give evidence worthy of a death sentence against him. I don't see that as Shae just being a bitch for the sake of being a bitch, I see that as her trying to get her own back for the pain he caused her (obviously not realising that he tried to send her to pentos BECAUSE he loved her). Would be interested to hear other peoples thoughts on this."
12966,gameofthrones,"So my goal of this post was just to give some background on Brynden Rivers to show watchers who would have gone by without ever knowing about him. I must have re-written it like 5-8 times trying to find a balance between too much info and not enough. This should in no way be taken as gospel as I have left so much out. As the day goes I know I will think of 100 things I should have included or changed, but there comes a time where I just need to stop, or I'll work on it forever.

12967,gameofthrones,But we only hated Jaime to begin with....
12968,gameofthrones,Yo that is really great stuff man thank you.  But do you think you could give him a lightsaber maybe? and then add in Anakins face? and then the body? That would be G reat.
12969,gameofthrones,"Ahh I feel you, I just cycle for fun, no racing.  But I really wanna do it so I'm not spending the spring and early summer trying to get my legs back when I could be using a trainer."
12970,gameofthrones,"Perhaps that's because 5 foot 8 isn't actually short, it's just not tall.  
  
Source: I'm 5 foot 7.5 Inches tall, although I say 5'8 because I'm trying to squeeze an inch in somewhere."
12971,gameofthrones,The sex scenes would be hentai lol
12972,gameofthrones,I scrolled so far to find this. For some reason I couldn't remember what he looked like in the show. They don't stop talking about him in the books 
12973,gameofthrones,"If this is the scene, where Carice Van Houten is essentially feeling him up, than yeah."
12974,gameofthrones,"They thought he was a bigger part of the overall story. In reality, he's only part of Sansa's  origin story, like Drogo was to Daenarys. This left people feeling disappointed when ""his"" story went nowhere."
12975,gameofthrones,"Wrong sub.

r/tumblrinaction"
12976,gameofthrones,is she less obnoxious in the books? In the series she just looks like a grown woman acting like a child who gets what she wants by getting men or dragons to do it for her.
12977,gameofthrones,"She's the lucky cast member, all she has to do is change her face and no one will bug her"
12978,gameofthrones,"I may be ignorant here, but how do spoilers work? This seems like a “I don’t know what they’ll  do with GoT” karma grab. "
12979,gameofthrones,This pic definitely has spoilers just fyi
12980,gameofthrones,Dont tell anyone about /r/asoiaf 
12981,gameofthrones,Man what a brilliant joke.
12982,gameofthrones,Prepare for your mind to be broken trying to follow the Targ names. It is very good though. 
12983,gameofthrones,"This happened in my life, expect I was the Marie."
12984,gameofthrones,Why would they be idiots to do so?
12985,gameofthrones,Let's hope it has something to do with an Arya + The Hound reunion of some sort.
12986,gameofthrones,I said he was careful when being intimate with Ygritte not that he didn't sleep with her. 
12987,gameofthrones,Indira Varma/Ellaria Sand
12988,gameofthrones,"Seriously, though. Tell him the Internet thinks he's smokin' hot. 10/10 would buy a drink."
12989,gameofthrones,"My main two gripes were the overused CGI and all the filler.  The Hobbit, a book shorter than any of the three parts of LOTR, was made to be the same length as the entire volume "
12990,gameofthrones,You mean the 140 page novelisation of the last season?
12991,gameofthrones,"Just wait, bud."
12992,gameofthrones,Yikes
12993,gameofthrones,I think it's probably just arcane fire or some shit
12994,gameofthrones,Running straight is the fastest way to get out of range. It's not a terrible strategy. If Ramsay would have charged his cavalry instead of firing an arrow zig zagging would have put him further behind. As it was it was a pretty lucky shot at that range.  
12995,gameofthrones,Just realized Jon got saved by his aunt and uncle back to back. 
12996,gameofthrones,"Well duh, that's The Pounce that was Promised."
12997,gameofthrones,Isn't she his aunt technically?
12998,gameofthrones,"""Shit...I didn't read the footnote at first...but apparently I could have just used the ointment on its own. My bad."""

13000,gameofthrones,"I randomly clicked on the link without fully reading the title. Was wondering what the big deal about the two pictures were.

Then I realized that both pictures weren't Sophie Turner...

Well done. "
13001,gameofthrones,"To be fair, the helmet part makes sense. His main advantage over The Mountain was his speed and agility, and wearing a helmet would've impacted that. It's not like if his speed and agility failed him that would've saved him anyway."
13002,gameofthrones,Happy tugs tug boat
13003,gameofthrones,"Yeah, but nobody else can confirm that. Not to mention she had already told the other Vale-Lords that Lysa committed suicide. So in the eyes of the lords she is either lying now, or she lied before (which makes her completely unreliable in her other accusations). "
13004,gameofthrones,Tormund taking a note
13005,gameofthrones,I died at that line lol. Sounds like a GoT porn parody line
13006,gameofthrones,This scene is so good that it didn’t even occur to me at the time how goofy it is that Pedro Pascal is presented as like a dozen years older than Peter Dinklage.  He sells it.
13007,gameofthrones,Reddit does make the submitted posts of a user available as an RSS feed (https://www.reddit.com/user/ChrysWatchesGot/submitted/.rss) Might be able to use something like IFTTT to trigger some alert or just hook it into a feed reader if you can find a way to filter it to this sub and has tl:dw in the title.
13008,gameofthrones,"So many parralells today. I particularly enjoyed how Tormund said Jon snow is ""no King"" which I just found cool in relation to daenarys this episode. The contrast is crazy. People rise up against her and she wants to crush them, and she unleashes her dragons and really doesn't suffer in battle at all. Jon loses his brother, is covered in blood and sees the real horror of battle and seems scarred by it in a way we don't see with Dany. I really wonder what is going to happen when those two meet, but I imagine the White walkers will play a huge part in how that goes down "
13009,gameofthrones,I just want to be here before this post.. blows up
13010,gameofthrones,"Tbf jaqen said she was finally no one right before she left, that's complete training in my book.

You could argue it isn't, and that training another is a form of training itself,  which would further improve her skills. But if she were to train another that implies she can see through lies already"
13011,gameofthrones,Just think about the jokes that would come of it - the Starks went from being the most killable family in the series to most unkillable 
13012,gameofthrones,Hot Pod the Rod God.
13013,gameofthrones,"I would love for Cersei to win and keep hold of the Iron Throne, only to realise she has no power as Jon, Dany et al have decided to create a constitutional monarchy and her role has become purely ceremonial."
13014,gameofthrones,the seed is strong...
13015,gameofthrones,What about he dragons and white walkers ?

13018,gameofthrones,Every time i saw him I'd scream BILLY YOU FUCK! Loved him and his huge arms in season 1. These feelings deteriorated by the end 💁
13019,gameofthrones,"Point you missed: Supplies are more important, Dothraki will easily overwhelm Lannisters after their formation has been breached, Daenarys wants to instill fear, thus some people should SURVIVE the attack."
13020,gameofthrones,"Also, he/she/they may be purchasing this for someone else"
13021,gameofthrones,"I don't get this, though. Don't they want Dany out? The fleet being burned only solidifies that she's not going anywhere because she can't. They could have waited a few months and when she sailed away there would have been nothing to stop the masters from taking over again."
13022,gameofthrones,Mine stood in front of the projector. It was still projected clearly onto his shirt.
13023,gameofthrones,The main question would be wether she legitimized him as Jon Targ or Jon Stark. I think with how intensely he's identified with the Starks and the North he'd probably request his mother's family name. 
13024,gameofthrones,Even drawing parallels between the sex life of a pervy old maester. The attention to detail the writers put in to this show never ceases to amaze me.
13025,gameofthrones,"I've been rooting for the white walkers since we've seen their gathering thing last season. They look like they've got their shit together, unlike literally everyone else in the show."
13026,gameofthrones,"The card probably has 5 as True, but ehhhhhh.

13032,gameofthrones,I don't know how anyone can compare any character to fucking Ramsay.  He's the definition of Pure Evil.
13033,gameofthrones,"If I remember correctly, book-Tyrion had the classic Lannister blond hair speckled with black hair. That was translated into the show as dirty blonde."
13034,gameofthrones,And screams of frustration will be heard down the street
13035,gameofthrones,Yep! She's damn cute.
13036,gameofthrones,You didn't even spell your username correctly.
13037,gameofthrones,Lays down some tremendous potential for her namesake.
13038,gameofthrones,I would say wife that but I have an ex who was an amazing cook but a horrible person. She used her delicious food as a weapon. I still miss her white lasagna and baked potato soup. Her not so much.
13039,gameofthrones,"I always liked her, sad to see her go. But she also foreshadows Jaime's undoing, and I will be sad to see him go too! Just look at the mercy he gave Olenna. The mercy contrast so well against Cercei getting the cruelest revenge she could think of against Ellaria. "
13040,gameofthrones,"I don't think these statues are actually in-universe either, I figure these are sort of like the faces on the wall for either the S6 or S5 teaser, not actually real just there for promotion.

The only one I believe that would be there is Ned"

13046,gameofthrones,"Worse than losing something your profession and life revolved around, then losing your 3 kids, then watching the person you've loved for decades become a twisted, wicked monster?

Damn your life must suck"
13047,gameofthrones,"I don't think they traveled very far. They could have been zigzagging looking for a wight, and just for a few hours, or maybe a dozen. Gendry only needed to run back in a straight line. 

Arya was very weird and we don't know what is going on in her mind yet. That part is a mystery, so give it time. 

I don't see the issue with the Dany. What's the big deal here? 

Daenerys falling for Jon is also pretty natural? Although she hasn't shown anything conclusive yet. Just an emotional scene after she lost her child. Again, what's unreasonable? 

Benjen was probably informed by Bran to come. Not a plot hole. We knew he was around, and he made it clear that his purpose was to help in the fight. At most, this is a bit of an oddity because his timing was great, but that is just for the storytelling. 

Tormund and Viserion died - both pretty significant. Yes, there haven't been *huge* deaths this season yet. They could be saving it for next week's episode. I suppose this complaint is valid, but it's not a plot hole. But dude, Tormund *surviving* was amazing. We knew due to the nature of the show he might very well die. It was very tense. Him surviving, emotionally, was just as powerful as him dying would have been. 

The plan to go north of the wall has its issues, but I have to defend it partially. In Jon's mind, there is *no hope at all* unless he unites the families. Yes, showing a wight to Cersei isn't all that likely to work, but what better alternative is there? If you make specific points about why the plan sucks I can go into them. 

I don't fully agree with you about the writing. It's not bad. It's still very very solid and captivating. It's just very different, and part of that is that this is the endgame and we're not focused on developing characters with long dialogues anymore. Everything is in action now. If you focus on the dialogue (or lack thereof) that the show has, it's still amazing. Great examples are all the conversations last episode that happened north of the wall. "
13048,gameofthrones,Coming 2023.
13049,gameofthrones,Ate something sour
13050,gameofthrones,"Yes, of course there passed several years since we first saw Rickon. I didn't mean to imply that Rickon stayed the same while everyone else aged. ;) Rickon was 6 years old in season 1 and is therefore supposed to be 11 in season 6 (= same aging as his siblings), but the actor was already 14 when they filmed season 6. And most of the time there's a significant difference between an eleven year old kid and a 14 year old teenager."

13074,gameofthrones,Right? I hate how Dany thinks she has the right to the throne because nearly over 20 years ago her ancestors sat. Bish 3 Kings have come and gone since then.
13075,gameofthrones,Did you have purple contacts?
13076,gameofthrones,Tormond of course.

13096,gameofthrones,  Now Sam will be pissed at Dany for killing his father and brother. He will use the family sword to kill her and her dragons.
13097,gameofthrones,Too soon
13098,gameofthrones,"Then write around the fact that we have plot armour. Don't write a situation where its obvious. Don't have Jon fall into the frozen water and get left behind, we know he's not drowning. Don't have him re-emerge into a horde of white walkers, don't have Benjen jump of out nowhere to stick him on a horse with no explanation. Don't have the shot of Jamie sinking into the depths of the lake. Don't linger on Tormund being separated from the others if the Hound is going to go back for him. Don't have Arya get stabbed three times, show the knife twist, then have her jump into an infected river without consequences if you aren't ready to kill her off. Don't write your plot armour protected characters into situations where they need an obvious ass pull to save them for the sake of cheap drama.

But it's OK, D and D finally got to include their zombie polar bear, which is far more important than good writing. "
13099,gameofthrones,Second only to Lyanna Mormont

13104,gameofthrones,"this post should be the first not the rest of the nonsense of these thread

we had 10 15 super fan theories to explain why Arya was walking around enjoying life and whistling and they were so good and well thought, and in the end it turned out... she was just suddenly super dumb :DDDD

the show doesnt make any sense anymore, why are even ppl trying to explain the nonsense is unclear to me"
13105,gameofthrones,"You are absolutely correct! They are very similar swords, though."
13106,gameofthrones,Yes I’m one of the teaching assistants in our manufacturing engineering lab

13112,gameofthrones,He's funding Jon's wildling army with his limitless sheckels 
13113,gameofthrones,That whole sequence immediately brought to mind the baptism scene in Godfather 1 for me. 
13114,gameofthrones,It'll be discovered in hundreds of years and completely mess up their historians' view of what the 21st century was like.
13115,gameofthrones,Wow.... that’s super impressive 
13116,gameofthrones,"Not in that world. People were becoming leaders, warriors at that age. Most did not even live past their 30s, so 14 could be described as the prime of many of them. Especially the commoners that did not have the same luxuries as the lords and ladies. That's why a lot of girls were basically married off once they had their first period. "

13123,gameofthrones,Nice reaction but tbh Jon's resurrection was like the most obvious plot twist ever. This show is just not what it used to be
13124,gameofthrones,"I had almost this same conversation with my cousin the other day. She asked if I'd would still read the books, and I said yes, because they're so many side plots and characters that have either never made it to the screen or have had totally different stories in the books than onscreen. I want to find out how the whole thing ends."
13125,gameofthrones,What is the spoiler? The dragon?
13126,gameofthrones,I wanted to see them be a family so bad. My heart hurts. 
13127,gameofthrones,Uh... no one else has. She burnt or killed all the other rulers.
13128,gameofthrones,"Technically, Arya dropped out of No One School. People keep ascribing her almost superhuman abilities -- the ability to detect all lies and deception everywhere and anywhere. 

She didn't complete her training, though. And she kind of sucked at the lying game, if I recall. 

Plus most of her training (that she DID complete) was focused on lying convincingly -- not *detecting* lies. There is a HUGE difference. 

(I'd also argue that it's not that hard to lie to a small, desperate child.)

"
13129,gameofthrones,"God the writing in AGoT is so good. Currently on my rewatch in season 4 and writing is amazing. 

Still enjoyed Season 7 but I would be lying if I said I wasn't withholding some expectations for S8 writing. "
13130,gameofthrones,The whole point of a bastard is that they don't get to wear their father's family name. 
13131,gameofthrones,For her pleasure?
13132,gameofthrones,Actually it’s not told exactly correct and doesn’t make it obvious here.  Thanks for nothing. 
13133,gameofthrones,"Awesome costume, but I have to say, I think you could pull of Renly even better."
13134,gameofthrones,Definitely season 8.

13138,gameofthrones,Where's my Xp for discovering it?
13139,gameofthrones,"Other way around, my friend. Shelters are the number one customers of puppy mills. *Ethical* breeders take very good care of their dogs, control the breeding, and screen potential owners."
13140,gameofthrones,"Eh, i was just going through the top posts of the past week. This post was on top. "
13141,gameofthrones,They could do an Empire Strikes Back thing and only tell the real ending to the actors involved in that scene but keep everybody else in the dark.
13142,gameofthrones,Is that Sansa and Daenerys faces on either side of the helmet?
13143,gameofthrones,Ya also basically his entire family has been murdered since the last time we saw him talking shit like that. That might put a downer on your personality. 
13144,gameofthrones,Hmm....wonder if I can get it to run on Linux...I'd be down to re-up for a bit.

13146,gameofthrones,"It blows my mind how often this needs to be brought up.

13252,gameofthrones,"**Hot take**: Rhaegar's marriage to Lyanna was shortsighted and selfish.

It's hard not to look at Rhaegars actions here as a reckless and selfish given what followed. He may not have been able to predict the exact series of events that played out afterward, but he had to know that this would cause trouble. He *knew* his father was an insane despot. He *knew* there would be massive political consequences *and he did it anyway*. In the books there's the three-headed dragon prophecy and all that, but even if you buy into that it still paints Rhaegar as a prophecy-obsessed romantic idiot with delusions of grandeur. No matter how you spin it, he knowingly laid the groundwork for civil war for the sake of either love or prophecy. I imagine all the people who died for Rhaegar's stupidity cared very little which one it was.

This isn't a unique view by any means but I think in many ways it's a more interesting take on the character than just ""soulful romantic hero""."
13253,gameofthrones,"Yea.. imagine this in the hands of The Night King... the mightly blue flames!

13254,gameofthrones,I'm willing to make bets

13274,gameofthrones,"I think it’s different in the show, but in the books Stannis is the first one to find out, he brings his suspicions to Jon Arryn and they investigate together, and then he flees after Jon is assassinated believing that he’ll be next. Littlefinger, Pycelle and Varys seem to have known for a while though, and although it’s not confirmed I’m fairly sure Renly already knew as well"
13275,gameofthrones,"No, the theory comes from the books. The mountain's head is supposedly sent to dorne, and Qyburn is a sick fuck, so he put Joffrey's head on the mountain to create Robert Strong. The other theory being that he's headless under the helm. Neither are likely true for the show anyway."
13276,gameofthrones,7 hells!
13277,gameofthrones,"Yep. He's just a child who acts like it, with some primitive ideas about chivalry and honour that he tries to act on. Good heart, very poor social skills. Didn't seem to hold a grudge against Sansa for slapping him either. The real hero of GoT!

In the books, the White Walkers do talk, and do not look shrivelled/undead. In fact, they're supposed to be *beautiful*.

The 'Night's King' in the books was an early Night's Watch commander who fell in love with a white walker woman. That story got a little hard to bring into the show, thanks to the weird decision to make the White Walkers themselves look like corpses.

So, as far as the books go, the White Walkers may very well have a 'society', with complex motives."

13306,gameofthrones,"George's face has a certain sadness to it, perhaps because he realizes he can never break fans hearts by killing off Arya"
13307,gameofthrones,It definitely is. That piano wasn't there two months ago.
13308,gameofthrones,That must be Tyrion's direwolf
13309,gameofthrones,"Edit: my bad yea its either Waters, Sands or Snow. He is a Targeryian that was born at Dorn and raised at winterfell. lol"
13310,gameofthrones,"I also feel that they merged Sansa/Jeyne with Lady Stoneheart. She seems to be taking up the vengeance aspect of that character and I hope that develops more. I want to see her become ""stonehearted"" and just lay waste to everyone that's wronged them."
13311,gameofthrones,I had them for dinner last night. Still smiling.
13312,gameofthrones,Who’s the dude with the long greasy hair?
13313,gameofthrones,"If you ever watch the making of the Lord of the Rings movies documentaries (which are fantastic by the way), the size doubles they had for the four hobbits were interesting. For Sam and Frodo they had two men who were dwarfs, but Pippin's double was a very tiny Asian woman, and Merry's double was like a 9 year old boy. So I suppose there could be options for Peter's double? :P"
13314,gameofthrones,"All of the potential options would have been good decisions.

An alliance with the Ironborn would keep the Greyjoys from attacking Lannisport/Casterly Rock and the Westerlands in general. They also could essentially have taken the place that the Boltons eventually did or they could open up another front in the Reach or counter Stannis' fleet. An alliance with the Vale would have kept an extremely powerful faction from siding with Robb. And the alliance with Dorne kept the Dornish from siding with Renly/Stannis. Each plan had a huge benefit for them.

Yes the plans carry risk, Tyrion doesn't particularly trust Littlefinger. But all the plans carry some level of risk, the Dornish may decide to act on their long held grievance with the Lannisters and kill Myrcella or use her as a hostage. The Ironborn might give up on fighting in Westeros and go home to their islands or betray the Lannisters and attack the Westerlands. 

I don't see the Dornish plan as more advantageous than any of the other options.

You have to remember that at this point the Lannisters were losing. They had nothing going for them. Robb was destroying Tywin's army, Renly was starving the capitol and massively outnumbered them, and Stannis was ready to launch an attack by sea. Tyrion needed to take that risk to gain any possible advantage, he couldn't play it safe.

These are not poor decisions. It wasn't exactly up to chance, he thought these through carefully enough to incorporate them into a plot to expose Cersei's spy. They had to all be real plans in order to convince the others. "
13315,gameofthrones,"No Bronn, you can't have a castle yet."
13316,gameofthrones,"I'm not sure, but it says this on wikipedia.  ([2nd paragraph, last sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones))

But just because there was a paperback re-edition obviously doesn't mean that all editions are changed forever more.  "

13322,gameofthrones,"i think the only part of post-Michael Office that i didn't really like much was the whole camera crew guy crush on Pam thing that went on for a few episodes. It just felt so shoehorned in just to add a small conflict for Jim and Pam. He just shows up on episode and keeps popping up every now and then throughout. It just didn't really sit right with me. It wasn't quite ""jump the shark"" level bad, but it spelled out ""we don't really know what to fill the next few episodes with."""

13330,gameofthrones,"Ramsay is also well written, doesn't mean I'm rooting for that sadistic, cowardly little shit. Tho I'll admit that his attitude was funny sometimes."

13338,gameofthrones,Honestly it looks 700 feet tall in the show. Thats about two football fields. Sounds right eh?
13339,gameofthrones,How much for the floor model?
13340,gameofthrones,"haha!  I know right?

And I feel like in the books GRRM made it so her looks are **actually a legit & *major* part of her characters** world-view, reactions & thinking (I know she doesn't *think* of how unattractive she is) but u know what I mean - u can tell that her thoughts and choices and especially her assumptions are all informed by the insecurity etc that she has from being treated so badly for not being ""hot""...its her pressing on and *moving through* those feelings and her commitment to her ideals that become super admirable and so much more meaningful when we see how she maintains all that honor and commitment **despite** how terribly she feels (& how terribly she's treated.)  

Anyway, I'm ranting now ... point is - Gwendolyn C. is way cute IRL & (if she had a choice & wanted to) book!Brienne would take show!Brienne's beauty in a heartbeat!!!! GC becomes even hotter when u think of how she's *supposed* to look, y'know?"

13353,gameofthrones,"Just a shame about the words on there; they'd have looked _so_ much better without the design being interrupted by random lettering making a heavy-handed explanation of what the thing is. It's like putting country names on flags - a bad idea.

I've a feeling the designer made them without the names/mottos and some boss insisted he stick them in there because he didn't think people would be able to figure out the symbols otherwise. (which might be right, but .. yesh)

13374,gameofthrones,"Yeah, happens near the north pole and even northern Canadian islands. There is no land at the north pole and the ice cover grows and shrinks over the year. 

It can get so thick as to stop sea travel. In the old days the Europeans were hoping for a ""northern passage"" over Canada to Asia, but it was always frozen. Many ships would get stuck in ice for the whole winter or even destroyed by the ice. Crazy stuff. 

Then there are icebreaker ships that go up there above Russia and Canada to keep shipping lanes open or to conduct research. I think the ice has been melting faster or not covering as much in recent years though. "

13377,gameofthrones,"Let's not forgot the magic Raven that travelled instantly to the south. Then Dany not only found the rock in the middle of nowhere, but she found it just in the nick of time. There was no visibility either, it's not like it was a clear day with blue skies, so she wouldn't have been able to see the army from a distance.

The undead army that was scared of water, yet at other times they were piling up on top of each other in a heaping writhing mass that could have easily been used to get over the water hazard. 

The gigantic chains they used to pull the dead dragon out of the water. 

This show was good because of the writing, the intrigue, the subtle turn of events, the gradual build up of conflict, the really deep rooted passions and motivations of the characters. The last episode we were left with a ton of D&D fan service and soap opera drama. "

13394,gameofthrones,"Maybe it is the writing, but Varys could have aligned with the slavers after he was unable to convince Tyrion to decline an alliance with the red priestess.  Remember the look on Varys's face when she began reciting his own traumatic past to him?  It could be that Varys felt Tyrion betrayed him, and when you consider what Varys did to the man who cut him and his abject fear of magic, aligning with the slavers could be a plausible move.

This only works if his chatter about the Targaryens and Dany being the true heir to the seven kingdoms was for political opportunism - a likely possibility considering it's Varys - or that his fear of magic is greater than his allegiance to the Targaryens."

13414,gameofthrones,"I've seen it argued elsewhere but *much* of that has to do with the fact that her plot on Essos doesn't have as much going on. There are literally less things happening in Essos than Westeros, and so there is less to drive her arc. That she's in Westeros is going to do a lot more for that. "
13415,gameofthrones,"My mate and I have argued over this for about 10 years, he *constantly* claimed Lyanna was actually kidnapped and raped by Rhaegar and I said they'd fallen in love and it was an open secret among a select few who realized it.

13416,gameofthrones,"I said the same thing when I was watching it.  The first spear should've given her pause, but instead she gets pissed.  She's done with burning the soldiers and the food by that point (and she could've had the Dothraki destroy the scorpion after she got further away from it), so returning to make the pass that got Drogon injured was just because she was angry.  She needs to play it smarter in battle, otherwise her foolhardy, vengeance-fueled decisions are going to cost her dearly."

13487,gameofthrones,"I mean, my point is that in the book and the TV show they make a point of showing people thinking of the white walkers as legends but knowing dragons were, at some point, real



People at first don't believe that Daenerys has live dragons either. But it's more believable since people acknowledge that at some point they existed.

It's just that all her life she's dreamt of becoming a knight, and society took that away from her simply because she's a woman. I know it's unlikely, but it'd be pretty poetic if all the boys who dreamt of wielding Dawn would scowl bitterly upon the realization that the title of The Sword of the Morning befell on a woman.

I have no idea how the Dayne's greatsword would somehow stumble into her hands, though, but I can dream."

13539,gameofthrones,"And if you were to tell me that any author did this, Martin would be the one I’d guess first. 

Man’s a prolific writer, but he seems to get bored/inspired often. He started off in Science Fiction, then hopped over into the Horror genre, leaving his ‘Tuf’ and ‘Thousand Suns’ worlds unfinished. I’d bet that he had more scary stories in him, but the failure of ‘Armageddon Rag commercially had him working in Hollywood on scripts for ‘Twilight Zone’ and ‘Beauty and the Beast’. 

THEN he left Hollywood to write novels again: because “Novels don’t have production costs”. While working on a Sci-Fi story, he had a vision of a medieval family finding wolf pups in the snow, by their dead mother. 

Man’s a brilliant author, it’s undeniable. But he seems to appreciate the freedom to write what he wants. It’s quite believable that the pressure to finish Songs of Ice and Fire turned it from a beloved projected into a chore around book 4 or 5. 

I always wonder about all the novellas and short stories that died in that man’s mind, because he’s trying desperately to focus on a story he’s already told to himself over 10 years ago. "

I had no problem with the scene between Dany and Drogo in season 1, or the background rapes at Craster's keep in season 4 (well, I had problems with the scene, but not for that reason), but as soon as I criticized this one, I'm some kind of censorial tumblr activist? Ridiculous."

13674,gameofthrones,"Some of the Freys weren't even at the Red Wedding. Walder and Lothar sent away any Freys that were sympathetic to the Stark cause so they wouldn't warn Robb what would happen. Some were also coerced into it too.

In my mind, killing Walder Frey and Lothar and Black Walder were enough. They planned the damn thing. Killing the rest of the Freys is way too similar to when Dany crucified the Masters of Meereen."
13675,gameofthrones,"I thought the same after the conversation with Jorah.

13679,gameofthrones,"To be honest even in a breeding program with numerous selfing generations, while you theoretically approach homozygosity for a trait but there's still the possibility the recessive allele reemerges within the population, especially when having a recent two generations prior.

Given this, even if Roberts grandfather was homozygous dominant for the gene, recombinations with a recessive dominant gene would result in a fully heterozygous F1 population. Aka Rob's dad (Bb). Assuming both Rob's dad and mother we're heterozygous for the gene the likelihood Robert is also heterozygous is about 66%. 

While theoretically this gives every child he and cerci have 50% chance of being blonde. The probability that all three children are blonde though would be 0.5^3 = 0.125 or 12.5%

But his army of White Walkers seams to be formed with living humans turned by him, like Craster's baby boys. Note that there aren't baby white walkers, they must have risen to become adults. I had a thought that their only living relative is Gilly's baby Sam, since he is Craster's son. Maybe Sam Tarly will raise him to become a fighter (Azor Ahai) and use Hertsbane on the NK, or maybe something to do with baby Sam's blood (keep Melissandre away!!!) ..."

I just convinced myself I didn't really care about things being spoiled and a lot of it was really interesting.

13722,gameofthrones,"I heard the opposite. Grrm was frustrated by the budgetary contains of writing for tv so he wrote asoiaf to do all the stuff he couldn't do as a tv writer. He made asoiaf epic in scope, intricate in detail, and sumptuous in spectacle. He wrote with both the expectation and indeed the objective that asoiaf be completely unfilmable...which he says bit him in the ass later when he had to adapt the battle of the blackwater for the show"

13798,gameofthrones,"It has nothing to do with the GoT-universe idea of a dragon. GRRM stated that he intentionally went against traditional mythological descriptions of dragons because of real-life evolution. No animal in existence had 4 limbs and wings, therefore, he chose to make his dragons two-limbed with wings. He essentially took what is considered a wyvern in real-world mythology and called it a dragon.

That was Sansa's whole defense-- she did the ""wrong"" thing even though at the time it was the right thing. That monologue wasn't just fluff to make Arya seem like an unfeeling bitch or to make Sansa look bad, it was to show they've both been in situations where doing the wrong thing is right, and Dad approved. Ned would have approved of Sansa writing that letter, and they both know it.  "
13828,gameofthrones,"Robert was infatuated with her because marrying her would have made him Ned's brother and he would finally get what he couldn't so easily (like whores). Robert wasn't infatuated with Lyanna because of anything to do with _her_, nevermind her looks."

It is unknown at what age dragons reach reproductive maturity. **Dragons never stop growing as long as they live, and they can live for centuries**, though many died in combat before reaching such an age. The largest Targaryen dragon, Balerion the Black Dread, lived for nearly two centuries and had a skull the size of a carriage.

13896,gameofthrones,"I am guilty of only watching the show and the whole first season even part of the 2nd is just her being a snobby brat who is essentially trying to be a gold digger.

I've watched GoT at least twice now. Some episodes more than others. But I have never *seen* Oberyn's death. I always cover my eyes or look away once The Mountain starts gouging his eyes out. 

I've heard the noises but I refuse to actually watch that scene all the way thru. There are some things that I dont need to see and Oberyn's brain spaghetti is one of them"

13950,gameofthrones,Do you think Jon can handle Tormund's member?
13951,gameofthrones,"Doesn't he say though that the dead can't pass through, implying that that's his reason?"
13952,gameofthrones,Ser Ten could field an entire legion of his own salt wives
13953,gameofthrones,"Well, I'm not so sure about that. 

In **Sam's** case, I'm not sure that the White Walker had any idea he had Dragonglass... in his defense, I'm sure he thought it was as good as gold to take as he pleased.  A fat kid and a girl with a baby he wanted? Please! That came out of left field.

In **Jon's** case, I think you saw what a White Walker will actually do... which is fight extremely well and almost kill a very skilled fighter.  Jon barely won that fight and it took a lot out of him...  The White Walker appeared to have been toying with him a bit... his reaction to Jon's sword NOT breaking told the story, there.

In **Meera's** situation, I can't imagine that the White Walker wasn't thinking they'd have some weapons/magic to fight them... yet he wasn't really ready for it, I guess? Not really sure.  Either way, Meera is no slouch. They are famed for guerrilla warfare and tactics - so throwing spears is something they do well.  It was a great throw to a vulnerable area... 

I think, over time, they will stop being so casual about the fights.  For Sam and Jon's encounters, the White Walkers have the excuse that they didn't know the enemy had the means to kill them.  Perhaps the Meera encounter was a lack of respect or intense focus on finding Bran?"
13954,gameofthrones,Sad bear

13957,gameofthrones,"I was really surprised to see them back in the opening episode - and so centrally, too.  They were hated last season.  It's not like they could brush it off as simply die-hard books fans loathing them, either: even much more casual viewers said they were awful, and pointed out that Oberyn chose to duel - it's not like he was murdered."

13960,gameofthrones,I just now got done reading the chapter where Belwas was the one to cut down the dude outside of Mereen. Hahaha So much better than in the show with having Daario do that part! 
13961,gameofthrones,Don't feel bad... I honestly had the same thought. Pretty masculine looking Dany
13962,gameofthrones,"Right, and if both Cersei and Jaime get credit for Olenna (Cersei orchestrated it, Jaime carried it out) then Arya should definitely get credit for Littlefinger.

Also, Cersei has Ellaria on her list, but she specifically stated that she was keeping her alive. "

13968,gameofthrones,"I pity him. His parents were killed in front of him, everyone and everything he ever knew was destroyed by wildlings. Then he goes to castle black because he has nowhere else to go, to the place where they have been fighting wildlings for generations and perpetuate the narrative even further that wildlings are the bad guys and the Night's Watch are the good guys. THEN, he witnesses/participates in a battle in which even more wildlings assaulted the wall, killed even more protectors of the realm (to him), then Jon wants to help them.

 I know a lot of people are sarcastic with the Olly hate but if you really expect a child to understand the complexity of the situation after what he's been through, come on now. It would be more out of character for him NOT to kill Jon. I loved Jon as a character and hated to see him die but I only feel an immense amount of pity for Olly, which is what I think the show was going for having him in tears when he stabbed Jon, but whatever, the GoT audience isn't known for reacting rationally to everything...cough rape scenes cough"

Maybe the books will remember that foreshadowing. Show Tyrion doesn't seem to want Dany to use her dragons at all. Book Tyrion would be all about that shit. I seem to recall his last encounter with the Kings Landing Town folk basically ending with him telling them he wishes he let Stannis kill them all. "

13992,gameofthrones,There is also the fact that she is supposed to be killed by a younger sibling due to the prophecy.  And technically Jaime is also her younger brother.
13993,gameofthrones,"If he really did it and it's not a clever special effect, my guess is he either projected the pattern on the snow to guide him or used a GPS tracker with an arrow he followed.

14006,gameofthrones,[deleted]
14007,gameofthrones,"I mean. He was going to alert the guards, which would have put Arya in the same shoes as Sansa. But Arya would have been probably been stuck in a room or cell knownkng her rebellious nature. She had to do the stable boy or be taken captive. Can’t blame her.

14016,gameofthrones,"She complains about how she's been treated, but for me the point is that she doesn't give up. Also, even if it is slightly hypocritical, I think she's just snapping out of frustration with Jaime because she sees him as having had this privileged life with very little adversity, and watching him whine about his hand (valid) she's like finally you've joined the rest of the world in tragedy and you're already ready to throw in the towel."
14017,gameofthrones,"I had the idea that Malazan Book of the Fallen is written by two people? I haven't finished yet, I'm still at the beginning of Book 9 so don't spoil me. But I agree with your assessment of the chain of dogs. I think that a lot of politics is behind closed doors since none of the POV characters are the really powerful ones, where GoT is more politically driven but we don't see the repercussions for smallfolk as well. Maybe Tehol has political power. But yes, also a huge fan. I started reading because it was recommended to me when I ran out of GoT and I haven't been at all disappointed."
14018,gameofthrones,You might be on to something...
14019,gameofthrones,I’m not certain. I assume it’s fairly close based on the age of the kids and how they mature as well as when the girls are able to reproduce.  They talk about the girls getting their first period around 12-13.  Which would be similar to earth years and aging.
14020,gameofthrones,You knew some shit was going to go down once Yara called him her protector. However I will say his decision to jump ship kept Yara alive. Although she is going to have a very not good time. 
14021,gameofthrones,That sounds right!
14022,gameofthrones,"Indeed but even without battle, the Wildlings would probably stop following him immediately and the North gave him his crown and if he relinquishes it then he has no mandate any more.

Plus, if he bent the knee she'd expect him to help her fight Cersei which he can't afford to do. "

14032,gameofthrones,"kinda wish the cup had a few drops of wine so it doesnt look like a cup of water. very cool eitherway
"
14033,gameofthrones,"The way I figure it is that it had something to do with where it hit, there was an explosion when the spear hit and I am assuming it hit an organ that had something to do with breathing fire. Like maybe if the ice spear hit him in the leg there would have been a slow spread of the ice/cold and slowly extinguished his fire/life, but the spear hit him in the fire-sack and released the inner fire and extinguished it all at once, so he died almost instantly? Idk, it sounds cooler like that"

Meh... Bronn had what he *thought* he wanted.  While I acknowledge his apparent reluctance about continuing to be a sellsword, I think at the end of the day, Bronn just doesnt know of anything else to do with himself.  He tells himself he wants those things, and that he's tired of fighting, but yet he *always* readily jumps right back into it.  At the end of the day, thats who he is... its what he does.  Thats what soldiers do... they bitch, and moan, about hating life as a soldier, but in the end... they live for the fight, and wouldnt have it any other way.

At least, thats my take on Bronn."

Edit: Except for Ramsey, WOOF WOOF MOTHERFUCKER!!!"
14077,gameofthrones,Being born on third is not the same as hitting a triple.
14078,gameofthrones,"This was amazing.

I would LOVE if the reveal had Bran bring Jon along to the Tower of Joy scene and we then got to actually see the marriage in a flashback. Beyond curious who they might cast as Rhaegar."
14079,gameofthrones,The canonical ending won't be written for 5 years...
14080,gameofthrones,"They did have a variation of Rains when she was coronated, though."
14081,gameofthrones,Could you imagine the purple wedding with Joffrey being 12-13? That'd be dark. 
14082,gameofthrones,"Yeah, you're right this is probably the case and that's a pretty great analogy too."

14094,gameofthrones,"Ouch. My sister put on Dear Zachary (if you haven't seen it, it's devastatingly sad and rage-inducing. Don't watch it.) for my parents a while ago, and they paid little attention, then both got up and went to the kitchen and missed the most dramatic heartwrenching reveal of the movie, so we had to rewind, and my mom's reaction was basically a monotonous ""oh no."" 

I don't think we finished watching it. And we too have stopped showing them movies/tv shows with any expectations that they'll pay attention."
14095,gameofthrones,yeah that one was amazing
14096,gameofthrones,Especially not a character as major as Tormund.  
14097,gameofthrones,"Virtually every character in every story is faced with the same question. Who am I?

These stories have so many well defined characters on the journey to answer that question is a big part of GRRMs genius. 

The Starks also changed a lot over the course of the stories. 

So does Jon Snow. 

Lots of really well defined characters growing and changing. 

Great fiction. "
14098,gameofthrones,"Tyrion is gonna fall in love with dany, I guarantee it, which is weird that's her half brother "
14099,gameofthrones,"Did anyone else think that Jorah would say he was saved by a Tarly to have Dany pull a weird face and be like ""oops burned his family""?"

14107,gameofthrones,"If you are dismissing watching your father's beheading, being tormented by the sociopath who killed him for months, being married against your will and underage, being almost murdered by your aunt, then being married again and raped constantly and brutally for weeks.... uh, you have a really weird definition of a sheltered life. The point of Sansa is that so many people tried to protect her, but *they couldn't*."
14108,gameofthrones,"Ofcourse, it's evident from the video that Erika is such an idiot. I wish I never cross paths with her."
14109,gameofthrones,I.e. he had one beer.
14110,gameofthrones,I almost quit simply because Joffrey got off so damn easy. Poisoning wasn't nearly enough. That little shit deserved to be slowly skinned and dismembered or worse. 
14111,gameofthrones,"That post would be really really long. Like really long. Essos is big and extremely diverse. Way more so than Westeros. Your best bet is looking into The World of Ice and Fire. It's a companion book to the series that has most of these back stories, as well as geography, in it. "
14112,gameofthrones,"IIRC, he claimed to have at the kingsmoot

edit: may have remembered incorrectly. I reread some of the passage and Gylbert wants to go west as his platform. Might've gotten this mixed up with all of Euron's boasting/bullshitting around that time. "
14113,gameofthrones,I heard company and immediately had a futile hope croaker and co would show up in the last season
14114,gameofthrones,I heard he changed his name and is now just the Friend Formerly Known As Prince
14115,gameofthrones,"It’s hard to say something was abandoned when it never even got going. I think she’s in 3 scenes in TFA and one of them is her lowering the shields to the enemy...

14118,gameofthrones,"No, now it trends"
14119,gameofthrones,"it wouldn't let them through. Killing them when they did didn't help either. The NK obviously just had some sort of death wish out of the 3ER, and if he could kill him prior, theres no reason he wouldn't have.

14120,gameofthrones,Donkey?
14121,gameofthrones,"Depressed Melisandre is so fucking sexy, my God."
14122,gameofthrones,"Some of my favorite dialogue on the entire show is when Jon is talking to Mance and Mance is saying how the giant they killed was their king and was from a line 1000 generations old. And then Jon just says, ""Grenn came from a farm"". "

14130,gameofthrones,I never thought I would see classic comedy in GOT. Lol.
14131,gameofthrones,More likely £10 in my experience
14132,gameofthrones,"Damn, imagine having a crazy drinking night with Peter Dinklage while backpacking abroad. Guys had a trip to remember, that's for sure."
14133,gameofthrones,There
14134,gameofthrones,Why is she looking at his nostrils? 
14135,gameofthrones,"Him and Tyrion. Tyrion will remember Jon, she will steer Dany away from a war with him."
14136,gameofthrones,So he was probably just a weird dude and he knew exactly what he was doing? Lol
14137,gameofthrones,"It's odd that she has been typecast into a type of 'action star' role because in roles in films like Terminator Genisys and Solo she has really struggled (granted those movies were pretty crappy overall).

However, in more 'grounded' films that focus more on everyday relationships between real people, she does well IMO.  She was very good in Me Before You, and I also thought she was the best part of Dom Hemingway, playing Jude Law's character's estranged daughter.

It could also be that Terminator and Solo are the only other movies most people have seen her in, these films really struggled from both a scripting and directorial standpoint while GoT has excelled in both."
14138,gameofthrones,The finest silk from tralelalelaleday!!! 
14139,gameofthrones,Well clearly you're wrong.
14140,gameofthrones,"I just realized! They're not playing on max difficulty. That's why obsidian is an insta kill for wights. They set the difficulty to Apprentice, but in the books everyone is playing on Legendary."

14149,gameofthrones,"This is the core thread that runs through the series for most characters that are doing well in the game or at the very least still alive!

They all have had to be broken down completely to come back stronger than ever. The characters that have had this are most definitely going to be the last left. 

Jon, Sansa, Arya, Danny, all the Lanister kin. "

14156,gameofthrones,Jaime wearing a glove is also pretty neat.
14157,gameofthrones,"For the Eyrie, wouldn't Denver be taller?"
14158,gameofthrones,If that's the only culture or way of life that they had ever known then it's at least understandable and we saw that he was changing before he died.
14159,gameofthrones,Are you sure about that? Rome ended in 2007. Season one of GOT didnt come around until 2011. Seems like an awfully big gap of time.
14160,gameofthrones,I dont know what upsets me more. That that had happened or that I let Game of Thrones do that to me again. 
14161,gameofthrones,"Am I the only one that is totally transfixed by his voice, every time he talks?"

14165,gameofthrones,The world’s strongest man!?
14166,gameofthrones,Damn..that scene shot though. This episode was a work of art
14167,gameofthrones,My guess is that with the show being so dark and intense being goofy off screen is the only way they keep from losing their minds. 
14168,gameofthrones,"Could you elaborate on the worm part a bit, please? "
14169,gameofthrones,Her imaginary penis dilates a little bit more.
14170,gameofthrones,Excellent. Thanks for doing these! 
14171,gameofthrones,"There are more than one. There’s even a bike tour. Where are you staying? We took ours from Dublin and our tour guide is a ummm, this is so exciting, he was a Wildling! "
14172,gameofthrones,Drag in dragon?
14173,gameofthrones,"I thought it was some dumb shortening or jargon at first, like how people write i18n instead of internationalization."
14174,gameofthrones,You have done a bit of research and concluded it's fake on the basis it is very impressive and few cuts. But she has done them live. No way to fake that. She is just impressive... Period.
14175,gameofthrones,"this made me laugh so hard, thanks "
14176,gameofthrones,"Kinda does. The Mountain is DEAD. That thing walking around has his body but isn't him.

14177,gameofthrones,She kind of looks like I do when I poop. Just very present in the moment and yet somewhere very far away
14178,gameofthrones,"Ramsay was also handed everything. It felt like the writers catered to him. Every episode he was in, everything turned out completely in his favor. Is there a Mary Sue trope for villains? He was that.

Joffrey and Cersei are dispicable. They're disgusting. All of the loathing and hate you have for them is written in, and every once in a while you actually feel sorry for them, which makes the next time they betray your sympathy that much more egregious, and cuts that much deeper. Ramsay was a parody of this whole dynamic. I never once related to Ramsay, on any level. So every time he won the Sadist lottery, it was just an eyeroll. "
14179,gameofthrones,"he is with Dany in those costumes, her hand."
14180,gameofthrones,Did we all forget about Stannis? The one who ACTUALLY sentenced and punished Davos by cutting off his fingers? Some might call that justice served. 
14181,gameofthrones,Kinda like the Nazi wearing a digital watch in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
14182,gameofthrones,It will be reposted 20 times. Millions of people will see it.
14183,gameofthrones,"It's much more expensive and time consuming to CGI animal fur than dragon scales. Also the wolf that is used for Ghost is in Canada, and the North is in Ireland/Iceland

Unless Ghost is specifically needed, he'll probably remain a rare sight in the series for this reason"
14184,gameofthrones,"wow, this is absolute self entitled bullshit. shame on you.
like you're owed anything for investing time in these books."
14185,gameofthrones,"Oh man. I didn't give Gendry/Arya any credence, but this makes it feel a lot more poetic/have some actual legs."
14186,gameofthrones,Nikolai looks like a dorky dad haha

14190,gameofthrones,"Not really. His bannermen made a push against stannis and for king of the north. Also, stannis balls at the idea of an allegiance with the north. "
14191,gameofthrones,I agree with your rankings. Wheel of Time was too drab and boring for me. Loved ASOIAF and Mistborn. I need to keep reading Sanderson's stuff!
14192,gameofthrones,16? Seems excessive.
14193,gameofthrones,"I swear I heard a third word too, sounded like ""lamp"" "
14194,gameofthrones,Should be an interesting autograph.
14195,gameofthrones,Every character has had bad shit happen to them.  Having bad shit happen to you doesn't justify being a cunt.  She gets hate because of her actions and decisions.  Not because she is a victim.
14196,gameofthrones,Mordor
14197,gameofthrones,Gallivanting?
14198,gameofthrones,Yeah what's up with this shitty compression?
14199,gameofthrones,Same.
14200,gameofthrones,Burn it all!
14201,gameofthrones,"Exactly. Sam knows nothing at all about R+L=J, Rhaegar getting an annulment wouldn't seem relevant to him at all."
14202,gameofthrones,"I know, I think the first one looks so much scarier. I guess back then they hadn't fully fleshed out how they would have full grown dragons looking in CGI?...because I guess the current skull had to match the look of Drogon"
14203,gameofthrones,Only they won't actually defeat the White Walkers forever. This all seems to be cyclical.
14204,gameofthrones,Oof
14205,gameofthrones,"Not quite sure this guy would be considered “famous”, I mean a lot of people know the character he plays in GOT but it’s not like he’s Peter Dinklage or Emilia Clarke or anything"
14206,gameofthrones,Hold my sister/mother-of-my-children. I'm going in!!!!
14207,gameofthrones,^^^woo ^^oo ^oo f
14208,gameofthrones,"important to note is that not only does Dany believe in Him but he believe in Her. 

He did all those other jobs for himself and with great malice, a well dressed middle finger to the world screaming LOOK WHAT I CAN DO AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE IT. 

For the first time ever he's a part of something he believes in. "
14209,gameofthrones,"They say this all the time and it's never true (or true but only in the least possible way, like 1 extra 5 second scene)."
14210,gameofthrones,You are 100% what Daenerys should look like. Good job!
14211,gameofthrones,I LOVE THESE!
14212,gameofthrones,"The chainmail that's under the plate is enough to keep him on the bottom, and that is not as easy to get off. Plus, half of those armor pieces buckle on his backside."
14213,gameofthrones,It looks like more than a few kings have slipped on the stairs and impaled themselves. 
14214,gameofthrones,I honestly hate this kid with a burning passion. His jealously is just borderline psychopathic. 
14215,gameofthrones,I wish I could get to know Lena Headey irl and determine how much of her supreme bitchitude is real. She just seems so fierce all the time!
14216,gameofthrones,"I took a peek the Game of Thrones Fandom page. There are other suffixes like 'fyre,' which is used for one male dragon. (Possibly the runt or a bastard? The name Blackfyre is used for a Targaryen bastard, maybe it's the same for their dragons.) But mostly... (*squints at the page*) uhh... the naming process is a hot mess without any kind of consistency, apparently. For a second I thought I had it pinned down to names with ""A"" sounds in the end meaning they were female, but there are plenty with ""a"" names that are male as well. Same goes for names with ""-xes.""

*Bangs head against desk, probably the same thing GRRM did when he realized he fucked up naming all the dragons and forgetting to have a character dangle the hatchlings upside down to check their genders.*

It's not like Drogon likes belly rubs... and standing between his legs peering up is going to look stupid af.

&#x200B;

 Maybe it has to do with ""The Prince that was promised"" meaning both ""prince"" and ""princess."" Didn't Missandei mention something about High Valerian lacking a (ugh, English is not my native language so I keep mixing up the translation for nouns, adverbs and stuff) word to define something as male or female? I guess if they wanted to specify a lion as a lioness, they'd literally say ""the female lion"" instead of ""the lioness""?"
14217,gameofthrones,Why does he share the same name with other people? I think his baby brother was named the same thing...
14218,gameofthrones,Just spit my wine out...
14219,gameofthrones,"Ayyyyy Valve

They announced Team Fortress 2 on 1998, released it on 2007"
14220,gameofthrones,So I assume they weren't the only house with dragons? Is it ever mentioned what happened to the rest of the dragons in old Valyria?
14221,gameofthrones,"To be fair, it wouldn't have mattered too much anyways if she had been able to run :/"

14225,gameofthrones,"Some people really like the look of glasses, though. ^(I do)"
14226,gameofthrones,"Lol that's certainly fair enough. I do the same when it comes to shows.

But hey it's Reddit, you gotta call stuff out when you see it :P "
14227,gameofthrones,"his accent in the show is absolutely terrible and takes you out of any scenes.

i stopped watching this by season 4 or something but that's all i got.

maybe learn from Renne Zelleger(sp) who fucking mastered English accent in that movie."
14228,gameofthrones,"Pretty sure since season 3 or 4 it's been $100,000,000 budget but your point still stands."
14229,gameofthrones,It’s a good place to start though
14230,gameofthrones,How can you say that if you're not a book reader... Who said he has a fleet and who says he wants to marry Dany?
14231,gameofthrones,"Honestly, Clarke doesn't belong there. She's good, but she's not best actress material in this show."
14232,gameofthrones,A horizontal line?
14233,gameofthrones,"Chaotic oscillation about an asymptote is a ladddddderrrrrrr

14236,gameofthrones,"I didn't see this was in /r/GameOfThrones at first, so I thought this was a poorly done world map and you were trying to say we should get rid of Russia."
14237,gameofthrones,I mean. Season 6 is leagues better than season 5 which still did a good job of saving the clusterfuck thatbare books 4 and 5
14238,gameofthrones,They can change genders at will

14241,gameofthrones,"If I remember correctly, the book describes Robert at six and a half feet tall (~6'5""). 

Mark Addy is 6'0""

14249,gameofthrones,"""He was kinda shitty though""

""I would never doodoo that""

""oh crap,
I did it again didn't I?
sorry it just spurts out""

That was some Tywin Lannister's shit level gold right there!"
14250,gameofthrones,"I've always interpreted Genna Lannister's remark about how ""Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you Jaime"" as a view on their character and attitude. Tyrion and Tywin have their intelligence & wits in common; Jaime is a warrior and he himself said that he only felt alive when swordfighting or making love"
14251,gameofthrones,"It's a show comparison, so probably not that obvious. It's more clear in the books, Ned's chapters give a lot of insight to Robert as a person and his 'love' for Lyanna."
14252,gameofthrones,The books had a huge following. So much so that there was even an award-winning board game released in 2003. When HBO first announced picking it up I had no idea how they were going to be able to translate the books into a TV show and satisfy all of the book readers. Figured it had a decent chance of being a flop.

14259,gameofthrones,Dude it was because of W. (Bush) anytime he fucked up Britney would do something crazy. The government used her to distract people.
14260,gameofthrones,"I suspect that the people who paid the money to do this promotion thought through whether they ever wanted these thrones back. If HBO doesn't want them back, these cheap props are just left as interesting litter, able to be hand carried away as they almost certainly will be.  Otherwise, they might have a base plate anchor that requires not-very-mobile force to extricate? I'm sure that some hearty fan has tried to move one. I wonder what they learned? If anyone's knows, please tell the rest of us. "
14261,gameofthrones,"Thanks for this. My cousin and I were wondering why he jumped, and were left puzzled by it. This made it clear"
14262,gameofthrones,"First, thank you for putting this up. I’ve not come across these videos and very much appreciate having seen them now.

I have found GOT follows Machiavellian principles and Little Finger does resemble the lion and the fox (mostly fox) so now he looks to be more of a probability to me than before but not sold on it. I suppose time will tell!"

Loving the use of leitmotif in this show. That theme is distinct from the usual targaryan theme and the dragons' theme. It is specific to her relationship with Drogo and hasn't played since her vision in season 2, but without using words, the music tells us she is remembering Drogo's promise of the seven kingdoms."

By the time she was made aware of this it's likely that there would have been nothing she could do in the first place. Organizing all the supplies and troops and ships to get an army capable of defending the place would have taken too long. And even if it went out they'd have been slaughtered. Also, there is plenty of sea between the Island and the mainland. Euron's fleet wouldn't have run into the Island or been anywhere near it unless he had chosen to go there."

An example being Robb himself having to be declared King because there was no rightful line anymore, what with his choices being the bastard who killed his dad or a guy who has no claim to the throne. Renly was also all show and no substance, he only knows how to charm, not to rule. Ned would've been a fool to support Renly."

There's a scene at the beginning with fire and it smelled like a chemical spill; there's a scene with green fields and it smelled like super cheap laundry softener.

Link: [Season 7 Trailer](https://youtu.be/1Mlhnt0jMlg?t=102) - In the final cut, Jon is staring down the Night King on that platform between the fire seen [here](https://youtu.be/GWeRWUNaMUw?t=375). "
14482,gameofthrones,That actually already exists
14483,gameofthrones,Braavo*
14484,gameofthrones,Can confirm. This happens. 
14485,gameofthrones,I had prescription contacts to make my eyes look darker because I didn't like my Bright blue eyes for about a year so yes 
14486,gameofthrones,Yeah I guessed night king but the idea of Kim Jong un and north Korea invading Westeros made me lol!
14487,gameofthrones,"IMO, more of Jon Snow's companions should have perished during their suicide mission.  It was very un-Game of Thrones to kill off only one hero, (i.e., Thoros)."
14488,gameofthrones,He utilized the break in between seasons
14489,gameofthrones,"So how fucked would Westeros be if the white walkers could cross that ocean, or if the ocean was frozen enough to just walk across? The wall would seem kind of silly"
14490,gameofthrones,"Bella Ramsey is also the star of another show on Netflix called The Worst Witch (girl discovers she has magical powers, gets accepted to a magical academy, hijinks ensue—orginal books predate Harry Potter). Very talented young lady."
14491,gameofthrones,/r/unexpectedindustrialrevolution
14492,gameofthrones,I'm with you but only because her story has been pretty much useless except for keeping a couple other characters around that were basically exiled. But that might change when she comes to westeros.

14503,gameofthrones,IIRC Rob didn't read between the lines at first but was notified immediately by Maester Luwin (I think?) that it was Sansa's writing but the Queen's (Cersei's) words.

14507,gameofthrones,"The Tullys were in rebellion with the Starks.  The Freys were supposed to be loyal to the Iron throne.

14511,gameofthrones,Brace yourself. Dead meme's are coming.
14512,gameofthrones,Jon attacking little finger in the crypts? Is this where he learns he's a Targaryen?
14513,gameofthrones,At least she showed a range of emotions in her short time on screen (and did a great job honestly).  Lyanna so far has had one expression and a handful of one-liners.
14514,gameofthrones,Bran is the NSA.
14515,gameofthrones,I immediately thought about that scene when ramsey took his bow out. It was painful to watch.

14517,gameofthrones,That car seems very unbulletproof.
14518,gameofthrones,Here's hoping it's Cersei.

14520,gameofthrones,"Nope. Lollys is still kicking it, as far as we know
"
14521,gameofthrones,"Tormund confirmed, he's no god."
14522,gameofthrones,lots of cool artifacts too
14523,gameofthrones,Because Frankenmountain will murderize you if you question the decision. The whole sept situation gets to serve as an example of the new rule of King's Landing: don't fuck with ~~Aria~~ Cersei.
14524,gameofthrones,"I'm not familiar with this meme ;( watched all of GoT last summer, started browsing the subreddit just recently. can anyone fill me in?"
14525,gameofthrones,That’s great!  Actually I have told my daughter the origin story of Lady Brienne a few times (I like the “be yourself” message).  
14526,gameofthrones,I feel like you should maybe mark that as a Simpsons reference since it's incorrect
14527,gameofthrones,Maybe he was just one of the few child actors that grew up with actual acting chops and can pull off his tougher scenes.
14528,gameofthrones,"Doesn't count, as Westminster still could do something."
14529,gameofthrones,"Kit was amazing in season 6 and I felt like he was worthy of an award. This season, however, nothing stood out."
14530,gameofthrones,I think it's a fashion thing.  Everyone wore their hair in those crazy braids in Seasons 1 and 2 cause that's how Cersei did it.  Then everyone wore their hair like Margaery.  The Queen sets the fashion in court.
14531,gameofthrones,"No, he wanted Sansa to send Brienne away and suggested that she take drastic action against Arya (who Brienne is sworn to defend as well). Sansa sending Brienne away is supposed to hint that she's come over to LF's way of thinking."
14532,gameofthrones,This picture makes Jon look like your second choice IT guy that you only call when your first choice is too busy to help.
14533,gameofthrones,"They originally decided not to include it in the show because they didn't want to confuse viewers by adding in yet another part of Westeros that the show watchers didn't need to be worried about until for like 3 more seasons. They even went to the extant of hiding dorne on maps by folding it over a table or conveniently putting something in front of that area of Westeros. 

Then later in the series, when Dorne was full on added to the show due to some behind the scenes shenanigans, they added it but decided to just flip back and forth between ""Queen/ Kings of Andals and First Men"" and ""Queen/ Kings of the Andals, First Men and Rhoynar"". So while we actually hear the full version of the title more now it's not continuous and subject to the whims of D&D

14536,gameofthrones,I always loved that he became mayor of Hobbiton. He just *cares so much*.
14537,gameofthrones,So does Jorah!
14538,gameofthrones,That show will get stuck in production for years. We might never see an episode.

14542,gameofthrones,"I think he wargs into the first men, trying to stop it from happening.
He already is disconnected to the real world.

They still do it, and he is trapped in that body.

We also see the nk stopping brans warg connection, which should not be possible for another person.

We know he is able to warg through time.
Do the walkers know about humans because of the Transformation of other humans, or because they know everything because bran knows everything.

We know that the history doesnt change when bran interferes, hodor has allways been that way.

Or it could be bran talking to the children of the forest, convincing them to create the white walkers to unite westeros.


In one of the first seasons, we see a white walker spare sam. Why? They never do that.
They do because they want the news of their arrival to be spread.
Could the white walkers be a collective intelligence controlled by bran/nk?
If the theorie is true, bran had thousands of years to train his abilities. 





Sorry for the english, its not my first language

14543,gameofthrones,Cersei? She started off like a bitch but at least she was doing it for her kids. Now she doesn't even have her kids anymore.

14545,gameofthrones,[deleted]
14546,gameofthrones,"Yep! This is why physical penetration testing is a thing. Dudes like me get hired by companies to basically do things like that.

Typically if somebody wants to get access to your data (that's almost always what they want) it's easier to socially engineer their way to a terminal, or better yet, a server room than it is to actually hack it.

Don't even get me started on common security problems. If you've never heard of one, look up an over/underdoor tool, a thumbturn tool, and a crashbar tool. Between those 3 things and a basic understanding of lockpicking (all of which you can easily conceal on your person) you can open 99% of locked doors. Most times you don't even need to pick a lock or hack a door because some nice person will open it for you.

Even security doors tend to have crash bars for fire safety reasons, so without a secure frame (correctly installed, too) they are deterrents more than actual barriers.

The 'advanced' stuff is stuff like keycard cloning and tricking motion sensors but even that stuff isn't that hard for people who work in those fields. Cloning a keycard is stupidly easy."

14551,gameofthrones,Wasnt ghost the runt though?
14552,gameofthrones,"To be honest, knowing Arya, I don't think she would be scared like that by a Faceless Man. She trained with them, knows them, heck, she is one.

Sure she might think she'll lose a fight, but I don't think that would bring absolute fear to her."
14553,gameofthrones,"Do you really think Davos would let Gendry into the Dragon Pit and say, ""Hey Cersei! Here's the 1 bastard Baratheon that got away!"""

I do, I do, I love him more than anything."" A tear ran down her cheek. ""Tell him, you tell him. I'll do what he wants … whatever he wants … with him or … or with the dog or … please … he doesn't need to cut my feet off, I won't try to run away, not ever, I'll give him sons, I swear it, I swear it …"""

14557,gameofthrones,"Not very difficult if you have/rent a car and Google Maps, offline mode or otherwise. I would avoid trains at all cost, they're very slow and have poor connectivity. Coaches are much better, but can get very busy in the summer, so you might end up without a seat if you don't buy a ticket early enough.

Older people usually have a rudimentary understanding of English, however the younger generations are much better at it. If you're around tourist traps like Dubrovnik, Hvar, Split etc. it's likely that you'll hear more English than any other language, except maybe German."

You don't magically get better from the loss of such a long-term relationship, regardless of whether it's a spouse, a partner, or a roommate. It takes time.

People who are fighting for home and loved ones are going to fight much harder and are going to be more motivated. You're also going to have much better recruitment if people were allowed to actually have a family. Never understood why the Gift and New Gift didn't form a town where the family members of Night's Watch could go to if family was allowed.

14674,gameofthrones,"Completely agree. That look was interesting and showed that he feared what she'd become and recognised she truly was a monster and he was worried. Then he's just acted pretty chill about it. I'm not saying he should go kill her but I expected to see more turmoil and conflict. Unless we're just meant to accept that Jaime has just given up caring about anything and is just along for the ride now. (although he won't be, when the time is right they'll flip the switch and have him do something) "
14675,gameofthrones,"Well I have to give it to them, D&D certainly didn't leave us fucking hanging. Shit has hit the fan.

On a side note, I like that they killed Littlefinger, it's kind of symbolic of the fact that all this political bullshit, that has been the entire premise of the show for most of these characters, is no longer important. "

14733,gameofthrones,"I don't think he would take the risk of attacking major population centres by himself, so the likes of King's Landing are probably safe for now. But if the countryside is overrun by roving bands of wights, then it looks pretty damn bad for humanity. They can't move armies (especially once winter arrives in earnest) and would be bottled up in the remaining castles, cities and holdfasts.

The blood magic thing is interesting. I doubt Jon would do it (especially with Davos counselling him), but maybe Melisandre will go to King's Landing and use blood magic to protect the city? Cersei would 1000% be on board with that."

14737,gameofthrones,"Nice find. I really enjoy the arrangement of all the characters in this scene - the seven Starks lined up side by side, with the three who will eventually live on the left and the four who perish on the right.

In addition, for the characters who were not touched:

* He commands Bran to show his muscles and foretells that Bran will be a soldier - Bran becomes a cripple.

* He asks Arya for her name, and she later joins a guild of faceless assassins with identity issues.

* He calls Sansa beautiful, and Sansa gets tossed around by all the powerful men in Westeros.

Even if this scene is a coincidence - which, in all likelihood, it is - it is very amusing."

14751,gameofthrones,He could just be reacting to that scene because you reacted to it. Even if it was the first time you saw it you got emotional dog would recognize that. Then you've been rewatching the scene since and have made dog the focus being watched or filmed. The dog would essentially become trained to react to the scene.

14755,gameofthrones,"Yeah, Robert didn't even *know* her personality, from what we learn. He was in love with the idea of her, and that has to have been based on looks. "
14756,gameofthrones,"I think the training in the House of B&W might have been more subtle than any of us realise.

What we do see is that these — cult members seem to have complete control over their faces.  And along with that, they study the other things that define a person, such as their gait and mannerisms.  This is important, because it means that in all of those scenes where we saw Arya in Braavos, especially the later ones, there are many different ways to interpret what happened depending on who was wearing whose face.  The original Jaqen could have been long dead, just a face filed away alongside a set of behaviours and a back story.  In some scenes, Arya might be the Waif.  The Waif might be Arya.  Arya might be dead.  In fact, it **might not even mean a lot whether she is dead or not**.

Hear me out.

Let's say you were given the ability to change to another person's face, at will.  You can also perfectly imitate voice, posture, etc.  You have access to all that person's memories and experiences, because at some point in the past they were inducted into the cult, then their character was painstakingly extracted and written down.  You can hold this form for as long as you like.  And let's say no one saw you transform.  At this point, what ties you to your original, ""true"" character?  Just your ego.  Your wants and attachments, and your sense of association to, and investment in, the original person that you were born as and that you shaped through your formative years.

In order to truly become no one, it makes sense that the Faceless Men would want to eliminate the ego too.

And suddenly the House of Black and White seems to draw a lot of parallels with Buddhism, in that it is a cult (or way of life if you prefer) in which the final achievement is ego death.

This might have been the true price that Arya paid.  The name, face, mannerisms and story of Arya both became a costume that anyone can wear.  So it was with the original Jaqen.  No one is truly Arya now, because Arya the character is filed away and taken out again like a costume as needed.

Who is playing as Ayra?  Some soul.  It might be the original soul that developed the wilful, rebellious character of Arya, or it might not be.  But it would be pretty meaningless even if you could find out, because that soul identifies with ""Arya"" no more than the next person.

Arya's story is perhaps the most depressing one in all of Game of Thrones: that of total dissociation."

3. Red Wedding  
4. Drogon vs. Scorpion (last night)
5. The Door

This photo of the Caligula bust has clearly been cropped on the right side, but that wasn't necessarily done as part of this. For example, this Roman history site uses the same photo of the bust (without Joffery) and it has the same cropping: http://roma-latina.com/empire/empereurs/caligula.html

While both photos have clearly been chosen to maximise the apparent similarity, it's not clear to me that the photo of the bust has been significantly altered in any way involving the facial structure or eyes."

Women are supposed to be delicate and pretty. Men are supposed to be tall and good fighters. Westerosi society looks down on the two of them because they don’t fit the narrow gender molds. "
14818,gameofthrones,Underrated comment.

“shit”

Have the daughter/ murdered then rape Ellaria and murder here , or have the daughter raped/or both.They're were pretty hyped up for her death, this si the women whoo murdered her daughter in cold blood."

When everyone around you is at least  (again I have a bit of a hard time believing some of those heights but anyway) between 5 and 10 inches shorter than you, you're bound to look huge. "

14883,gameofthrones,"Not really, hence why people want to know more about it. Basically the people manning the fortress are the Eastern version of the Night's Watch and there was a theory going around that if it takes Dany too long to invade Westeros and the Long Night begins, one Targ will defend the West (R+L=J) while the other will defend the East (Dany) to even out the balance of ice and fire."

14909,gameofthrones,"I have a teensy suspicion that she'll still be alive. They made a point of having Qyburn explain that the poison could take days or weeks depending on one's constitution. Otherwise why have that original scene in the cells and the others of them bantering, and why keep mentioning a prettier wife and better castle?"
14910,gameofthrones,"Well that's the way it worked out, but he couldn't have predicted that with such accuracy.

I think archers were just the only thing that could hit up there so he took a shot in the hope it would be useful somehow.  What else is he going to do?"
14911,gameofthrones,"Going beyond the wall with no horses, no supplies and no fallback plan and like 10 guys led by the King in the North is one the dumbest things done in the entire series so far.

Dany could have ended the war right there by burning the White Walkers.

Dany instantly finding the random rock in the middle of nowhere."

14913,gameofthrones,"Welp, time for a dumb cunt flair "
14914,gameofthrones,"Look at the family trees again. There's more incest than you're probably expecting. It wasn't just the Targaryens that hopped on the inbreeding bandwagon. (They were the ones that drove the wagon off a cliff though)

 And everything is of course an average. "
14915,gameofthrones,Kudos for getting the eye color right!
14916,gameofthrones,"1) She lured Jon to re-take Winterfell in the first place to get Rickon back, knowing that if Ramsay really had him, Rickon was probably doomed. 2) She finally writes LF knowing she'll be beholden to him. She should have discussed this with Jon. Heck, she should have told Jon the truth about how she knew about the Blackfish. 3) She admits she knows nothing about battles, so when her apologists cite her brilliant strategizing as justification for deliberately withholding the **one piece of critical military information Jon does not know**, a better military strategy was not her motivation. So what was? In any case she misled Jon, probably caused thousands of Northerners to be killed unnecessarily, and endangered Jon himself. 4) Being indebted to the conniving and deadly LF now means that everyone in Winterfell is in danger. Sansa could have easily gotten rid of him and kept the Vale troops had she acted early on, but is not so adept at politics to have thought of that. A smart Sansa would at least warn Bran and Arya to be wary of LF’s stealthy ways and to be on the alert. But I doubt she will. Bran is sufficiently withdrawn and knowledgeable to be LF-proof. But since LF has sussed out how deadly Arya is, she’s his immediate threat. Being home and for the first time in years feeling safe, she's cocky enough to lower her guard. Yes, she’s trained in stealth and can detect lies, but LF is of Braavosi heritage and probably recognized her fencing style. He may even have guessed she's a FM. If so, he'd never lie to her, but find some other way to use her for his purposes. 
**Conclusion**: Had Sansa gone about it more openly and had more forethought about consequences, she'd deserve credit. She doesn't."
14917,gameofthrones,Oh I'll bet it's warm.
14918,gameofthrones,"As evil as she is, and as much as I despise her, I was 100% behind Cersei on this one.  The High Sparrow thought he had the world in his hands, and he would have if Cersei hadn't killed them all."

If the lords wanted Gendry on the Throne they could put him there. Which while farfetched, might be a good plan for a conniving and cunning Lord, to have a puppet king advance your interests.

Realistically Gendry would have to do some incredible shit to get anyone important to shit over all the rules of a feudal society and make him King, or even legitimise him."

Many are likely from the people that commit suicide in their temple, but we also know many are from people that have been murdered. As long as they could get their hands on the body, I imagine they would be fine with adding its face to the Hall of Faces.

What makes far less sense is the original ad having the faces of all of the main characters, many of which who aren't yet dead."
14976,gameofthrones,"Jon's arc is about uniting people against their common enemy. About showing people that they need to stand together or fall separately. That nothing matters more than defeating the Night King, because everyone dies if they don't.

It's a big part of why I think he'll keep the truth covered up- the Northern lords only trust him because he's Ned Stark's blood. They implicitly and utterly trust Ned Stark. If it comes out that he's not Ned Stark's son? He's the son of *Rhaegar Targaryen*? The man who, in popular conception, kidnapped Lyanna Stark and started a war that killed their lords? And now Jon went down south and came back pledged to a Targaryen?

The Northern Lords would never trust Jon again. And their help is essential against the Night King. "

And Jon will remember those are nice. So he'll be game.

15085,gameofthrones,"despite how the show has built things up over the last few episodes, in the books dragons are not immune to arrows. Yes the armored chest is fine, but joints and wing membranes as well as eyes/mouth/nose etc are all vulnerable. So massed archer fire can take down Dragons eventually. As far as I can tell there is also no reason why wights cant use bows (they use other weapons), and undead giants might be able to reach low flying dragons. 

Throw in undead magic, wight walker weapons (the ice metal stuff) as well as things like eurons rumored magic and there are ways that the dragons could die. And since its GoT, at least one probably will.

15221,gameofthrones,"Have to agree here. I barely comment ever and this episode has somehow moved me to. I'm late to the party too but who cares, I need to get this out of my skull. Am I the only one who was sad, yes, but inspired by Hodor's death? My inner feelings of GODDAMN DID HE GO OUT LIKE A G I NEED TO BE A BETTER MAN I WILL HOLD ALL DOORS WITH THE RESILIENCE OF STONE AND STEEL far outweighed the tears, streaming though they were. In the silence after the cut to the credits the haunting words echoed, certainly, but my mind immediately leapt to and kept repeating ""All men must serve, all men must die..."" as I was trying to cope with what I had just seen. Hodor seems to me to be the first character who did not ""serve"" and then die in separate consecutive steps as every other character has done thus far. Hodor's true purpose in life, his ""service"" to gods and men, is inextricably intertwined with his death. Sure, some characters may have been destined to sacrifice themselves for a good cause or have visions about the way they will die, but nothing approaches this. It feels unprecedented and oddly inspiring in a way I can't put my finger on. He truly served and truly died simultaneously, in wretched harmony, every moment of his life. "

15227,gameofthrones,"That’d also apply to Beric and the Mountain, wouldn’t it?"
15228,gameofthrones,"Well, that and compromise hasn't exactly been Dany's strong suit. She's stubborn, headstrong, and does what she wants. Sometimes it works out for her, other times it gets her city attacked and lots of people killed. Compromise is super important when you're a ruler of any sort."

It's admittedly shaky, because I can't say, “yeah, for certain, there will be no C&D.” But in all fairness, there likely won't. Fanfiction.net and other sites have existed for 10+ years, and very rarely do individual stories get served a C&D. It's because it's free, and branded as fan content. I can't read Dutch, but this manuscript should say unauthorized or unofficial somewhere in the content. As long as it isn't being sold for profit, it is UNLIKELY to be served a C&D. Unless this story goes mega-famous and OP is on morning talk shows talking about it, I'm pretty sure OP is in the clear."
15260,gameofthrones,I agree it's improbable but Sandor has been living with pious followers of the seven...

That's so in character for Jon given how much Catelyn hated him as a kid for being a bastard when it was never his fault.

15299,gameofthrones,"Ned admitted to being a traitor because holding fast to the truth he knew, that Cersei was having an incestuous affair with her brother and Joffrey was a bastard, meant his daughters would die.

Sansa reacts with shock when Arya talks about being there when he was killed-- Arya was there to hear the honorable Eddard Stark confess to treason he didn't commit, to do something wrong because it was right. How could Arya condemn Sansa for doing the very thing she saw her father do with his last dying breath, tell a lie because it meant saving the people he loved? She saw.

15353,gameofthrones,"It feels like we're overdue for a main character death. I'm not sure who that person would be, and maybe the show departed from the shock deaths in leaving George behind, but it's felt like every primary (and even secondary) is doing all right for themselves. I wouldn't be surprised at all if there's an unexpected death in the end of this season (my gut tells me Arya, in that she gets screwed by thinking she's outsmarting LF, but I can't imagine that because she's like, *the* fan favorite).

15369,gameofthrones,In the Dunk and Egg stories it seems like there's a stereotype of the Freys being nouvou riche idiots. In the show this materializes as them dressing like Monty Python style shit farmers.

15372,gameofthrones,"Chamblin Bookmine, Jax? "
15373,gameofthrones,"Many viewers hate her, so a lot of the fantastic stuff she does, especially her acting subtleties or nuances, go largely unnoticed. 

Another Cersei scene I love was her arrest, particularly the moments leading to it. As the High Sparrow went on with his monologue, you could see Cersei's facial expression slowly changing--from amusement to boredom to a tinge of anxiousness. You could see her gulping ever so slightly. And before long, her eyes were twitching in panic. "
15374,gameofthrones,GRRM needs to finish his books.  Let him give an outline to some other writers.
15375,gameofthrones,"I think diluting the currency is unlikely, it is something that is too easy to catch and could cause problems.  In the books Littelfinger's whole deal is helping himself and hurting others in a way that is almost impossible to track.  Tyrion, probably top three smartest men in Westeros, has trouble figuring out Littlefinger's scheme when he is Master of Coin.  If Littlefinger was debasing the currency Tyrion would have mentioned it.

Also, Littlefinger is clearly way ahead of the game when it comes to finance.  Turning two dragons into three is almost certainly a reference to his business skill.

Lastly, rubbing two dragons together to make a third = Jon/Dany baby confirmed."
15376,gameofthrones,My thought exactly
15377,gameofthrones,Shovel Knight confirmed for smash
15378,gameofthrones,"Relatedly, I wonder if Bran can see through the Faceless Men's disguises, or if they're strong enough to fool the Three-Eyed Raven. If Arya stands in front of him in disguise, will he know? Basically, which magic is stronger?"
15379,gameofthrones,I wonder if they said that he'd have to show his butt as part of the contract or just sprung it on him early season
15380,gameofthrones,"It does seem like a missed opportunity, since it seemed to me, when i read the book, that there was much less of a 'race' issue in the world of I&F, and more of just locality and class/houses/etc. "
15381,gameofthrones,Shouldn't take too long either
15382,gameofthrones,Damn and I was shipping those two so hard
15383,gameofthrones,Ever read David Wong?
15384,gameofthrones,Ay mods when you add the spoiler tag you should say what season the spoiler is for. I was worried I was gonna see a season 8 spoiler
15385,gameofthrones,"I noticed that everyone was wearing black. Cersei, Sansa, Jon, Daenerys... hell, even Littlefinger. It really ties in with everything that's been developing up until this point.

Also, did anyone else feel like Cersei has finally, completely snapped? Calling her son's suicide an act of betrayal. The bloodlust and desperation to conquer everything, or scorch the world to ashes trying.

This season is going to be *so good*."
15386,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I'm no prude, but I'd be legit concerned if this child actually understands what she's referencing."
15387,gameofthrones,I would LOVE a Robert's Rebellion movie/short series. Ahhhhh that would be amazing.

15390,gameofthrones,[deleted]
15391,gameofthrones,"Me too. I think with celebrities, they start mixing with groups who are looking for vulnerable people to feed off and exploit. The cult leaders make them feel like the most important people in the world, and that's it, they're gone."
15392,gameofthrones,When she showed up I almost laughed. it just seemed like another ridiculous Ex Machina that she's been surviving on for the entire series. I'm pretty done with this arc. 
15393,gameofthrones,Holy shit. Thank you!
15394,gameofthrones,Why you use the website? Can use imgur more easy

15398,gameofthrones,"Gilly gets turned into a wight, in order to save little Sam Sam has to kill her and stabs her through the chest, when he does so his sword begins to spouts fire, and then he slays the night king. Sam turns out to be Azor Ahai."
15399,gameofthrones,which halves?
15400,gameofthrones,"It would have grown back, she's gotta be cutting it. That youngest Sand Snake had hair that short in season 5 and now it's quite a bit longer."
15401,gameofthrones,"I love this!

15405,gameofthrones,Well with Randyll and Dickon dead...and Sam a man of the Knight's Watch...that kid could be the new Lord of the Reach.
15406,gameofthrones,"So he knows magic? How else does taking a mans toungue stop him from stabbing you for taking it?

Actually, when I think it about it makes sense. We know the the ships were taken from the iron isle's because they needed ships to cross the narrow sea, but within the time it took to cross the narrow sea, the iron isle's build AND sailed a larger fleet in time to attack the old fleet. While we are at it; magic would also explain how one fleet manages to sail and crash into an entire other fleet without anyone noticing. I mean, if its just to build the tension - isn't it cheap? "
15407,gameofthrones,"True, but when basically everything he writes is young adult then I have no idea how well he could match the tone of something like GRRM.

I'm reading Wheel of Time right now, 2 chapters left of Book 5 and while it's definitely a bit more grim it's not so dark as GRRM. So just because he finished this for Jordan I don't know how well he could do ASOIAF"
15408,gameofthrones,Except I dont think gon ever even saw meruem and he definitely didn't fight him
15409,gameofthrones,"I would liked to have seen how the Hoover Dam stacks up against the wall for comparison. 

Although -- Hoover Dam is 726'. The wall is 700'. I guess it's the large size differences that make these types of charts interesting.

So, if you want to feel like you're on the wall, go to the Hoover Dam and look over the low side. 

"
15410,gameofthrones,"Yep, I definitely feel that she already has everything she ever desires but that shot looked like it was just an empty hall. 

Which begs the question, is this early in the season or is this a shot in response to some war and defeat at the hands of the night king and Cersei is the last survivor, or the last known survivor. "
15411,gameofthrones,"There's that, but also surviving decapitation would be pretty shocking."
15412,gameofthrones,Idk that Arya is destined for romance. Him & Sansa seem a more interesting plot point.
15413,gameofthrones,"That isn't even the worse thing he has done.

He murdered his cousin who worshipped him."
15414,gameofthrones,No Stannis :'(
15415,gameofthrones,Hold on I don't get it
15416,gameofthrones,And is he even gonna get his warhammer back?  I thought I saw The Hound drop it at one point when they were getting overrun...
15417,gameofthrones,"Could the little minx be playing us?

OK. Everything other than the visual effects is quite terrible. I don't think anyone ever challenges the visual effects, just how bad everything else is which ruins it. I don't care how ""real"" the dead people look when it fucking sucks to watch. "

15425,gameofthrones,"It reminded me of when Greyworm executed those two slavers. They had been waiting to kill these people for a long time, and they were ready to get it done."
15426,gameofthrones,They traded Gendry to Melisandre 
15427,gameofthrones,"I read the books first, the way George wrote about the wedding made it almost seem like a bad dream, you didn't quite know what was happening until everyone was dead or dying. I had to reread it a few times before I came to grips with it and then threw the book across the room and didn't go back to it for a week."
15428,gameofthrones,"They could remove the last two words on that poster, and still it wouldn't surprise me. "

We're talking about blue light."
15431,gameofthrones,the one scene we havent seen from the trailers before the season began is when littlefinger seems like he's kneeling down on snow and he looks a bit distraught 
15432,gameofthrones,"Yeah but he will realise how to make VS or something to that extent, or at least a procedure to adapt it. "
15433,gameofthrones,"Why not just make him a knight of her Queensguard? The White Cloaks denounce their lands, which is an easy out to let Lyanna keep them. Plus, Jorah would gladly say, ""Fuck my lands, fuck my titles, just offer the chance to save your life once more, Khaleesi."" 

~~Plus, he can always drift off to sleep to the thought of what the last Lord Commander did to the last Queen.~~"
15434,gameofthrones,Good luck. What weight are you fighting in?
15435,gameofthrones,Here We Stand
15436,gameofthrones,"Serious question - Of course the video is brilliant and all, but could HBO take it down for using so much content from the episode? Or is it safe under fair use?"
15437,gameofthrones,Did you build castle black on the otherside?
15438,gameofthrones,Can’t. Still too hung up on the fact that the last season is missing three episodes. Can we fix that?
15439,gameofthrones,[removed]
15440,gameofthrones,"Yep, it's mostly a story about Ned's kids (and nephew), but not the one you would think it would be about."
15441,gameofthrones,"Yeah I don’t think this guy has even read the books lol. I don’t even think Bronn’s shown up since book 3, just mentioned every once in awhile."
15442,gameofthrones,Tyrion looking like Bernard/Arnold from WestWorld
15443,gameofthrones,Its worse on the Entertainment Weekly website cause going picture to picture you can see that they're clearly not sitting on the thrown but CGI'd onto it. Why they couldn't just take pictures of them on the damn ting I don't know.

15463,gameofthrones,"I'm not sure. I know most of the extras  are available online but I'm not sure about the commentaries. I doubt they'd be available on YouTube because they are entire episodes, just with people talking in the background. 

I always planned on just getting whatever box set they come out with when the show ends, but then I got the first 3 seasons at a record store going out of business sale do like 10 bucks a piece and after that I couldn't just have S1-3. They are well worth the money. There's interactive maps that actually gave me a much much greater understanding about the war of the 5 kings. You click on a house, it shows their troop movements, battles etc. And the episodes have an interactive mode too. And the commentaries, I never used to watch them, for any show. But GoT has made me love them. I threw in in one night while playing my Switch, just for some background noise and ended up watching every single episode of the entire series. Some of them give you great insight, they'll explain things they didn't really have the time to touch on in the show (in S5, when Ramsay and Rose are standing at the table talking about Stannis, ""The North is ours. Yours and Mine"", the map on the table in front of them was made out of human skin. They were aware most people would have absolutely no way to know that, so they made sure to discuss it). Some of them, it's just the actors shooting the shit and it's really great tv. Kit talking about how he did this little sword twirl in Hardhome and making them keep it in. Someone on the show broke their leg filming the scene when the wall falls down at Hardhome. Lena Headey apparently watches the show and she was gasping at the reveal of Jons parents. Anyways... I tend to go on a big old spiel anytime anyone asks about commentaries. They're so good. If they're not online, the first few seasons are less than 20 bucks at Walmart,  so even if you just spend a few bucks every few weeks it's worth it.

Also... if you like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, BCS ep commentaries are amazing as well. When Michael Mando was in Spider-man when it first came out, listening to the commentary from that time is awesome. The ones with Vince Gilligan are great. The ones with Michael Mckean are great. They're all great!"
15464,gameofthrones,"Egg,  I had a dream everyone was named Egg"
15465,gameofthrones,"In all honesty she probably just arrived like, ""Oh shit my people are in danger. I'm so happy my three friends/advisors are alive."" Not, ""One of you fucked up wtf m8."""
15466,gameofthrones,I really need to rewarch this show lol
15467,gameofthrones,I will always upvote this gif!

15469,gameofthrones,I'll admit I've never seen the actress that plays Brienne outside of the show.  Didn't realize how pretty she is!

15475,gameofthrones,"You missed a chance to refer to Jorah as ""Jorah the Explorer"""
15476,gameofthrones,"She's so cute and kind of dorky, I love her. "
15477,gameofthrones,"I think the best way the show could have done it was to have her be a whore put up by Tywin, but have Tyrion still fall in love with her.

I also wish the story of Tyrion's first wife was revealed like in the books.

Those two things combined would have made Tywin's murder feel a lot more justified."
15478,gameofthrones,So perfect. Now I'm going to be disappointed if this doesn't happen.
15479,gameofthrones,"HAHAHAHAH So now you're off it's fake and it's to... ""Oh she can't draw'... Dear god you are soo soo pathetic. "

Jaime: ""I. Am. The. Army.""

The you hear a scream and an explosion in the building.

""Both of them""

Edit. The Thomas Jane version just in case. I know there's been two more since then and this is kinda old now. "
15482,gameofthrones,Now I'm picturing Ned Stark yelling this right before he gets beheaded and it's pretty hilarious.  Thanks.

15484,gameofthrones,Where is lady Olena ?
15485,gameofthrones,"Didn't Frey also say something like ""you're not one of mine""? If so: Definitely Arya the whole time."
15486,gameofthrones,Which X is she? Shadowcat? 
15487,gameofthrones,Not always true. My system at work only requires a card number and expiry date to work.
15488,gameofthrones,That's what I always assumed about why they bring it up so many times
15489,gameofthrones,"I mean, over the course of the hours or days needed to shoot the Stark/Baratheon scenes at Winterfell Lena and Kit talked"
15490,gameofthrones,"That's awesome, but I thought she is supposed to have three dragons. I only see two dragons and a *camel*.  /s"
15491,gameofthrones,"Yeah, what this tells me is that the action is going to be bar-none incredible, which is great. But I'm worried the plot and characterization are going to be thinner than ever, which is not so great. "
15492,gameofthrones,"> ""Wicked""

definitely british"
15493,gameofthrones,"Another important distinction is between Cersei and Lady Olenna. Cersei says the line from the meme. In the same episode, Lady Olenna says she sleeps peacefully at night because she knows she has worked hard to keep her family safe. Paraphrasing here. Please correct me."
15494,gameofthrones,"7/8, no?"
15495,gameofthrones,"A man must act.
"
15496,gameofthrones,Sandor Clegane approves.
15497,gameofthrones,In the show his skull quite a bit smaller than that. Maybe a bit bigger than drogon :/ 
15498,gameofthrones,And people were wondering just how Cersei loses her baby......Sudden Infant Arya Syndrome.
15499,gameofthrones,To me it seems like most if not all artists post their work to Instagram and you even get some cool work in progress and behind the scenes stuff.

15507,gameofthrones,"There are too many to count! Creativity, how badass the cosplay is, and how people are able to bring the character to life are the three factors that makes a cosplay memorable. I’ve seen a lot in 3 years.

It’s always cool to see other GoT cosplay because it’s an instant conversation starter. Even if there are other Jon Snows I try to extend an olive branch because naturally some people see it as a competition and I just don’t think that’s right. Cosplay is all about the fandom coming together, you can’t let pettiness ruin a good thing."
15508,gameofthrones,I love the janitor
15509,gameofthrones,"I think he has the information but doesn't entirely know how to use it. That'll be where Sansa and Jon comes in. Get information from Bran, have Sansa use it to handle the politics and Jon to handle the military bit. "
15510,gameofthrones,There's like 12 characters in that picture and only 3 are still alive
15511,gameofthrones,No no no. St. Patrick was the guy who got rid of the snakes. Podrick is the one who brings it. 
15512,gameofthrones,"Maybe this is why they revealed her age and the medallion she wears  in the season premiere? They don't throw that in the show for nothing, they don't have the time."
15513,gameofthrones,I remember reading about this Willas in the 2nd or 3rd book. Olenna had intented to marry Sansa to him in the books right? unlike the show where they wanted to marry her to Loras.
15514,gameofthrones,Pretty sure it’s only there until Sunday so not much time!
15515,gameofthrones,It’s in the works!

Like....WTF  did I just watch "
15520,gameofthrones,I was always under the impression that none of them were false. Tyrion crafted 3 useful plans that would help his family in the war. He simply chose to follow through with the one that was exposed because he had paid the political price with Cersei already.
15521,gameofthrones,This white horse again. I think it belongs to Drogon's stomach now.

15543,gameofthrones,So it was cold?
15544,gameofthrones,"The first 5 episodes are good, the midseason are kind of bumpy and the last two are masterpieces. Overall a great season!"
15545,gameofthrones,"Gurley hurt his knee earlier and was trying to play through it, so he didnt have the same explosiveness he does normally

EDIT: Apparently he said he wasn't hurt, and McVay said he played like shit bc the Patriots sat 6 guys on the D Line and McVay didnt adjust well enough"
15546,gameofthrones,I thought it was Jedi Ron Swanson and Avatar Aang.
15547,gameofthrones,"Because? They did not do that with season 7 either? 

Besides the episode dates are already known... and that is not the case.

15561,gameofthrones,"Yeah idk why people think they would act any differently, it makes sense why he did it, no matter how wrong it was"
15562,gameofthrones,This was not only my favourite Dany moment but one my personal faves on the show; to find out EC's health issues were persisting around filming as well gives me a new level of appreciation for her and this scene.
15563,gameofthrones,"I believe the turning point is very near now. They showed the last sex scene between Jaime and Cersei in last episode just to make the point clear that they were in love, soon they won't be anymore. I think Olenna's words were more foreshadowing as well. Jaime is about to change."
15564,gameofthrones,This guy gets pleasure by killing our favorite characters and he’ll get more pleasure from not finishing the books before he dies...troll level - infinite 
15565,gameofthrones,Jenny gave Forest AIDS didn’t she?

There's a logical end game ruler for each kingdom minus the Vale (maybe Bran because ""he'll learn to fly"") and Dorne (lets just go with Bronn here so he finally gets his castle)."

15584,gameofthrones,"It is a bit of a mixed bag for Catelyn though. On the one hand Ned never cheated, but on the other he did not trust her enough to let her know the truth. I guess you can say he was protecting her as well, but at the end of the day he spent nearly 20 years telling her a lie. "
15585,gameofthrones,He was my favourite character of that season.
15586,gameofthrones,"OH I JUST GOT THAT. I didn't pay attention to that part, but I get it now. Jaime's her brother! Yesss, I got it.

15606,gameofthrones,"Exactly.  The family that's ruled them for centuries, who's word is bond, and one of the kid's is literally one of your deities now? That's pretty rock solid, in the North.  Though nobody actually likes Littlefinger, so it's not like some random Vale lord or northerner would stop a Stark from killing some creep.  "
15607,gameofthrones,The /r/dreadfort is going to be pissed about this.

15612,gameofthrones,"Yeah, I really thought we would see a possible alliance but Catelyn chose to run away."
15613,gameofthrones,"Yeah, that's the thing with me.  New one just blends into the show too much.  The other one stood out.  I did like the old ones sarcastic smirk though.  The new one doesnt seem to have it down yet."
15614,gameofthrones,She probably keeps a trophy from every victim.
15615,gameofthrones,I think that's the beauty of it.  Not everyone will like and hate the same episodes.  they will either relate/hate/love/meh different episodes for different reasons.
15616,gameofthrones,For the watch!

15621,gameofthrones,She was reading a book by a really boring maester about the number of windows and steps in the citadel and she got to the part about the annulment and then new marriage but then sam started being a dick and cut her off
15622,gameofthrones,"The Night King doesn't watch the show. He doesn't know who Danny and Jon are. He has an army of tens of thousands of humans who look just like them (though a little thinner).

Dragons? That's a different story. He doesn't have any of them and he wants to collect them all. Going for the one in the sky that is killing all of his toys makes more sense than going for the one trying to save 4 or 5 measly humans. Plus if he's quick he can catch them both.

If he does somehow know the significance of our heroes with his 'magical powers', then he probably has used those same magical powers to deduce they are not as big of a threat as the dragon flying in the sky burning everyone one up.
"
15623,gameofthrones,So that's how it is in their family...
15624,gameofthrones,"It wasn't obvious, you had to put the clues together yourself.

1) the villages that Gregor Clegane supposedly raped and pillaged were on the opposite side of Harrenhall from where he was actually operating (which we know from Arya chapters).

2) The Darrys are the ones that originally sent villagers to plea for aide.  Their stories were contradictory and full of holes but Ned didn't think to question them more deeply.

3) Beric Dondarrion was from lands known to be loyal to the Targs.  Thoros of Myr, as an Easterner, might very well have met and known Illyrio, Viserys Targaryan, and/or Aegon and the Golden Company (not in the show, but another Targ faction that is important in the books).

4) The Darrys supported the BWB and took them in (which we know from Arya chapters).  They also decorate their halls with Targaryan tapestries (again which we know from Arya chapters).

5) The events which initially drove a wedge between the Baratheon/Lannisters and the Starks, which was the killing of Sansa's direwolf and also the killing of the butcher's boy, all happened on Darry lands.  There is a strong possibility that they subtly engineered these events in some way.  We can also remember that their hall was strangely absent of tapestries when the Starks and Baratheons visited them--because they had hidden away all their Targ tapestries, as we would later learn in Arya chapters.

6) The BWB is still up to banditry and random chaos sowing well after Gregor Clegane has left the Riverlands.  We can see in later Brienne and Jaime chapters, if we pay attention, that they appear to be attempting to stir up trouble between the Freys, Blackwoods, and other Riverland houses.  

Their supposed raison d'etre has long gone, but they are still in operation because their real raison d'etre is creating chaos and discord between current ruling houses while preparing the populace to rise up in support of a Targaryan return."
15625,gameofthrones,I quit my job and started cross stitching bitcoins. 
15626,gameofthrones,It makes it look like the spear is a consistent size and the night king is two feet tall
15627,gameofthrones,"> Yea. Gregor was a pretty notorious rapist on top of being a murderer.

Thank you, now I see why people are saying it was implied rape. I was kinda confused since I had forgotten that fact."
15628,gameofthrones,"That's basically what that dragon is...close air support, fast moving, similar to a fixed wing, low flying aircraft.  I suppose it won't scar Arya's soul that much."
15629,gameofthrones,Maybe with the brotherhood? I don't remember him doing much though.

15654,gameofthrones,Should have discussed dental while the Night King recruited him. 
15655,gameofthrones,"Do any of the books outside Asoiaf describe how the Targaryens attempted to keep the dragons in line. I know they understand certain words and are smart but how did they keep them from eating and destroying everything? The dragon horn? Magic? Keeping them in the dragon pit in kings landing?

This leads me to how Dany will keep her dragons from inadvertently raping westeros, granted I think all of the dragons will be dead by series end or that magic will be relegated to North of the wall."
15656,gameofthrones,It's ironic since Cersei fancied Rheagar.

15692,gameofthrones,"I love how slowly they made this happen, too. In season 1 you assume you're meant to hate Sansa and she comes across as a character with zero potential. Her evolution into the character she is now has been so gradual that you barely even feel it happening, and yet here she is. 

I would truly love to see Cersei and Sansa see each other again and see how they react to one another. A tiny part of me wants to believe that Cersei did care about Sansa a bit (at the very least, related to her), and with all her children gone, Sansa might be the only person besides Jamie left in the world that she might have ever felt a hint of affection towards. I know she's ""too far gone"" as a villain now, but I just feel like I need some closure on their relationship!"

15731,gameofthrones,"Just to be That Guy, ""classically trained"" and ""going full method"" are actually somewhat contradictory, as the Stanislavsky Method was offered as an alternative to ""classical acting."" That said ""classically trained"" has lost a lot more of its meaning since the 60 and 70s saw ""method acting"" become the standard approach in film especially, and it's obvious that you're using the more common colloquial meaning, which is more equivalent to ""professionally trained."""
15732,gameofthrones,"Yeah me too, was just highlighting that"
15733,gameofthrones,"whereas the books basically fucking give it away in the first 30 pages.

the show did that way better than the books imo."
15734,gameofthrones,"I agree with this. It's like Sam's book knowledge--just a different kind of knowledge that Sansa had to pay attention to so as to survive in the ""lion's den."" Jon doesn't play the Game of Thrones; his interest has always been North. 

Sansa was located around the world of power peacocking from every player in King's Landing and knew firsthand how the powerful consider everyone a pawn.    She's warning Jon about a threat he doesn't see. 

I think I interpret a little differently Sansa's ""I learned a lot from Cercei."" I think she didn't admire Cercei's *skill* at the game, more the ferocity to keep what's hers."
15735,gameofthrones,"Your other half was a example for your argument, I thought I didn’t need to say anything about it. Also in what way was that condescending? Honestly don’t know,was it the structure of the sentence or a word I used?

Furthermore you might have misunderstood what I was trying to accomplish, using religion in a topic like this is a waste of time that leads nowhere, so I just didn’t want to go that way, even if it serves as a point.

Sorry if I sound like an ass again, thought my English was good enough but it seems I use words that are a bit airy-fairy, since you aren’t the first here on reddit that reproach me of that."

If you are using this as a means to justify the reasoning for them killing her, it would be better if Ellaria ever mentioned that portion of the reason, rather than calling it a murder. I'm fine with it being an irrational hatred, I am not okay with jumping through plot loops to somehow feel sad about Tyene and Ellaria.  They got what they deserved. Yes Cersei went overboard, but what about Cersei would make you think that wouldn't happen."

15789,gameofthrones,"Haha, I think Tommen would definitely have let them execute her. What happened to Loras is a good example of Cersei's reasoning: Margaery was cooperating and made a deal with the High Sparrow for Loras' life and legacy, and what he actually ends up doing is effectively killing Loras for his family's uses and some lowkey public torture. Loras went all in 100% cooperative and was literally only allowed his life. The cards were way more stacked against Cersei.  

You know, Cersei did do the obvious and stop Tommen from attending the trial. I don't see her as doing these moves for power or even, like she says, ""because it feels good,"" at this point I see her doing these things because the literal only other option is to give up. And this is why I love Cersei, she will keep on fighting and struggling and murdering regardless of anything, she's such a source of strength by herself."

15802,gameofthrones,"Yeah, as soon as he took off his crown and walked out of frame and the camera just hung there on the open shutters I knew Tommen was opting out. The only thing surprised me is that he tried to march off the windowsill in a somewhat kingly way. I thought Tommen was going to suddenly bolt and swan dive out the window just to disturb the calm of the scene.

But in a way it's far creepier that he just accepts it quietly. "

15848,gameofthrones,[deleted]
15849,gameofthrones,"I don't know if it was how they shot it or if it was because Littlefinger and the cavalry arriving was just TOO predictable (it happened with the Dothraki earlier in the episode, with Stannis north of the wall, and with Tywin and the Tyrells at KL) and overdone at this point.  I wanted to see Wun wun smashing a tree into the Bolton army, I didn't want Jon to play right into what Ramsay wanted, the ending was great with Jon Tormund, and Wun wun charging winterfell, but the battle itself just didn't do it for me.  The action was cool but it seemed very....lost almost.  Maybe that's what they were going for with Jon really not knowing what was going on but it seemed sort of just like a cool action scene compilation rather than a well written story this episode. Which was good don't get me wrong but I don't think it would be in my top 5 episodes. "

15875,gameofthrones,3D objects are often called models too.
15876,gameofthrones,"""Fell"" is a term used in Northern Britain (which is essentially what The North is an analogue of) for a large hill or mountain,  applied particularly in Scotland and to the Lake District region of Cumbria. It comes from the norse word ""fjall"", meaning ""mountain"". I would be surprised if this isn't the intended etymology of ""Winterfell"". 

Of course the norse analogues are the Andals; this could imply nothing, that the castle was built after the Andal invasion (which I believe was the findings of a master who studied the castle at one point) or that this is not the correct etymology. "

15884,gameofthrones,"It's subjective. Being nominated for an Emmy doesn't necessarily mean you're a good actress. Maisie is probably one of the worst on the show for me, and that's not an unopopular opinion (she's arguably the most ridiculed actor on the show after Emilia Clarke), but it is only an opinion. If you like Maisie then I won't try and convince you she's shit, but don't try and convince other people she's good because she got nominated for an Emmy, that's nonsense."

Same thing for the Hound, although I don't think they'll fan-service CleganeBowl for us, lads. Not sure what role he has yet to play, but again, they've put a lot of time into the guy.

This episode had so much fan service though. So many moments we've been waiting years for. So many little nods to the books, or to the fans. So much tension, both in the battle, and even wondering what was going to somehow stop Arya from getting home. Did anyone else want to punch that fat guard at Winterfell?"

15982,gameofthrones,"""When I apply that to the world Tolkien created in a time when no one else had created such fantasy worlds""  

This is not really right. Robert E Howard was doing several of the things Tolkien did, a handful of years before. Conan had vast and intricate, quasi-historical, very analagous fiction going before Tolkien. Howard was world-building, but for pulps. Tolkien is then, very derivative of the pulps. None of this is a bad thing, and this is naturally how literature grows. Also, Tolkien's interest in more than one disclipline absolutely helped his writing."

I can’t really see as good of a connection with him and dany now as a result. Not sure if it’s because he just lost someone in he movie he loved or if it was just the role. He sure seemed happy with the red witch though lol

16110,gameofthrones,"So Rickon *should* have run Serpentine, but he's just a little kid and was scared. I don't fault him for his Prometheus run.

I'm actually back to being alright with Sansa not telling Jon. She knew better than ""we"" did that Jon would fuck up and get emotional, so using him and his men as bait to lure out the Bolton forces for the Knights of the Vale was the superior strategic move, even if a lot of wildings had to die for it. I do not think Jon could have been trusted with that information, as much as I wanted him to be just as good at thinking as he is at fighting. 

Plenty of people didn't die from the arrows, I think they did a good job of showing that they were random. *Despite* obvious plot armor, I legitimately felt scared and worried for him when he was getting trampled, there was tension for me there. 

I agree that we don't care about Rickon, but I was legitimately worried about Tormond, very worried about Davos, and rightfully worried about Wun Wun. 

I agree that the Knights of the Vale was a deus ex machina, but I was ok with it. It's not like the show routinely has the good guys win because of a surprise at the end, and it happening this time just makes me more skeptical that it'll happen next time. 

I still think I liked Hardhome better, but just because people are hung up on Ayra in Braavos doesn't mean the writing was bad this season. More straightforward, absolutely, but having Sansa join Littlefinger in playing Jon as well as Tyrion talking some sense into Dany were both examples of great writing. Not to mention the fantastic writing for all of Jaime's scenes in episode 8. "
16111,gameofthrones,I actually find the typos as part of the charm and thought they were on purpose! Thank you for doing these. I've always looked forward to them :)

16117,gameofthrones,They are quite easily the worst actors on the show. Anyways awards don't mean shit since Game of Thrones got Outstanding Drama series Emmy for season 5 and 6.

Which, from Tywin’s perspective. It makes sense. His sons should marry nobles, not random lowborn women. Preventing Tyrion from marrying her was the strategic move on the part of the lord of Casterly Rock. But it was still pretty damn heartless, and it’s not as if Tyrion was a valuable candidate for marriage."

Part of the Grand Northern Conspiracy is that one or more factions are actively plotting to crown Jon. Howland Reed and the Flints ought to know of it, and some old Flints arrived on the wall a bit before the mutiny, presumably to scope out Jon and his adequacy to be dakingindanorf."

16271,gameofthrones,"It really annoys the shit out of me when people do this. This guy wanted to do the Hound. He made the Hound costume. He researched the Hound costume. He looked at probably dozens/ hundreds or Hound pictures to get stuff right. He spent a ton of money on materials for the Hound. He spent a ton of time on making a Hound costume. He literally meets the actor that plays the Hound, dressed as the Hound, and these guys are still, ""Lol, Sam!"" 



How do we not know he has a banging Sam costume too? And even if he did, if he posted a pic of himself dressed as Sam and took a pic of himself with the Hound, we'd have gotten, ""Lol, but Sam never even met the Hound in the Show?!"""

16278,gameofthrones,"I just started reading the books, but the show is different and I don't hold it to the books. In fact, the quick pacing, focus on plot points over dialogue and character development, are why I began reading the books. Season 6 was ok, but this season feels excessively rushed. In season 6, good things HAD to happen because otherwise all the protagonists would be dead. Now it just feels like wish fulfillment."

He didn't order the beheading of Ned, he married Sansa, he never listened to the evil advice of his mother Cersei and became a good king. With this marriage the North and the south became solid allies, no one dared to start a rebellion. 

Daenerys crosses the Narrow Sea Tyrion is sent as a diplomatic envoy to Dany. Tyrion asks for a training dummy and shows his slapping skills. Dany decides that she will instead form an alliance with the 7 Kingdoms of Westeros. She goes back to Essos to rule her Queendom.

White Walkers came, they devise a plan to get Tyrion close to the Night King and have him slap the Night King twice as many as Joffrey. Night King decides to remove the reanimation magic that he cast on the white walkers then kills himself.

16331,gameofthrones,"GOT doesn't split things like one story per episode kind of thing, but there is still a difference from one episode to another. For example, s7e6 shows almost exclusively the story beyond the wall. Or a battle doesn't go on for 3 episodes. It usually happens on one. 


Having 10 episodes kinda requires many things to be happening. Since the game is coming to it's end, many of the plots have been closed and the ones that are still opened require a bit more time to be closed. A battle with Cersei or with the NK needs more time than the other ones we have seen, but still can't go on for 2 or 3 episodes. That's what I think is the reasoning."

And yes, I agree, the show made him so much more likeable than the books, but as much as I usually appreciate morally ambiguous and not overly palatable characters, I can't bring myself to complain Show!Jorah's feelings for Dany is one of the purest, most beautiful, most unconditional loves in this show. And even though Dany is not sexually attracted to him, their bond runs much deeper than mere friendship. He's going to die a tragic heroic death north of the Wall, having fully redeemed himself and fulfilled his story.

16357,gameofthrones,"I found myself in a similar situation recently. A few weeks ago, when one of my employees suddenly completed all of his work in half the time, I admit it raised my suspicions a little bit.

Of course it also helped tip me off that he was singing “that candy white, that nose nasty, make my work go real fasty” while he was doing it.

After the drug testing, we found out he’d been on a steady diet of cocaine and amphetamines for the last 18 hours. Man had enough uppers in him to beat Secretariat in a five furlong footrace.

When Linda from HR told me all of this, I complimented her on her excellent rack. She reminded me I wasn’t allowed to do that anymore after the company-wide meeting, then informed me that we had a choice to make with our drug bunny.

Naturally, I did what any company would do and fired half of his deparment and put the remaining workers on the same drug cocktail. We’ve tripled productivity and have never been more profitable.

16364,gameofthrones,I don't wanna side track you but I don't think the origin of Jack was the only reason no one liked it.

Watch Jack scenes from the first then the last film and it's really obvious.

...That would be the opposite of smart.  Not only is Jaime the commander of the Lannister armies, with Randyll Tarly also captured and/or killed there is no one else in King's Landing that could be near as effective a military commander.  On top of that Dany is bound to know the close personal connection Jaime has with Cersei - she wouldn't in a million years just let him go back to King's Landing to tell her what he saw, when Bronn, Dickon, or any common soldier can do that."

Please, sorry, but you're totally wrong. Honestly, his world-building seems to be becoming more irrelevant as the story progresses, and we have been given a lot of detail that won't actually play out in the plot. That's not that hard to do.

Everything ""new"" that GRRM does or did was done by other authors: Glen Cook, Erikson, Abercrombie, to name just three.

I mean he was popular and the books are good, but let's not kid ourselves, they are not groundbreaking in any major way, in my opinion."

I'm hoping to learn what brought on the Doom of Valyria and how the Wall was constructed.

16588,gameofthrones,"> I think a lot of people too easily brush off Sansa's experiences and the horrible things that have been done to her because, well, we tend to do that to a lot of women in our society who experience similar things.

We do that to everyone. And looking at your other reply and how you disregard male victims (who are about [half]
(https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence) of domestic violence victims), you're a perfect example of this. This issue doesn't affect only women, but disadvantaged people as a whole, even more so in a medieval-*esque* society like Westeros. Just look at how Tyrion and other dwarfs are treated (entertainment at the purple wedding for instance) or how people remark on Theon and Varys being eunuchs. u/alterego890 definitely had a point when he said that it happens to everyone, yet you kept trying to make it seem like a women-only issue. I understand where that mentality might stem from, but it doesn't really help or solve the problem and I hope you could understand where I'm coming from with this.

Most of the episodes on this season are from the very best directors in the series, too. I highly doubt this will get boring, but i get what you mean. I don't think Clarke is lying though

The ending will probably dissapoint a lot of people, but ending series in a good way is always quite hard. I've seen very few series with good ratings on endings"
16594,gameofthrones,"This is when I knew GoT wasn’t going to be like the other shows.

This is why GoT is suspenseful and most shows aren’t. Most media won’t do something like slaughter their main protagonist in the first season. Far less plot armor than I’m used to. "
16595,gameofthrones,"Yes. This. Christ.
The first 10 minutes of that episode were some of the best ever broadcast on tv. From the pacing, the lighting, the music, the design. Fuck it was incredible. I still watch it on YouTube when I’m bored to get a kick. "

16598,gameofthrones,This is going to be some sick fan fiction now isn't it...
16599,gameofthrones,"> and the same age

Do we actually know how old they are? Or are we just assuming they're in the same range?
I've read all books and seen every episode but my memory is less than flawless. I vaguely remember at the beginning of the books Dany being something like 16 while Jon was in his early 20s. I could be misremembering though

Edit: Apparently in the books, Dany was only 13 when she was married off to Drogo. They made her 17 in the show due to the sexual nature of the relationship. Jon is only 14 at the start of the books, and is ~19 when he becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. But in the show, he is 16 in the beginning. So I guess by now in the book world, they'd both probably around ~20-21 years old, give or take a year, with Jon being roughly a year older, while in the TV series, they're probably closer to 23-ish, with Dany being a year older. Odd.

16609,gameofthrones,"In the real world, in ancient times, it was fairly common for rulers to adopt ridiculously long-winded titles. Xerxes in particular (the Persian king whose forces fought the Spartans at Thermopylae) had an absurdly long list of titles. By contemporary standards it's silly, but I suppose at the time it impressed the shit-kicking peasantry. "

16622,gameofthrones,"I'm not sure how it will go down, but I think Arya will be there, and I think she will put the Hound down in the end. (Hell, she might end up killing the Mountain, the Hound, and Cersei all around the same time to really put a dent in her list). 



I think thematically it would work really well for her to finally be the one to put the Hound down with all many faced god/god of death stuff. ""What do we say to the god of death? Not today..."" ""But maybe tomorrow? Valar morghulis!"" It would tie in well with the path the Hound seems to be on after the most recent episode. Him asking why he hasn't been punished, when in fact him still being alive may be his punishment(that Arya, working through the god of death bestowed by not killing him when he wanted death).  



Would be cool to see it come full circle and her putting him down after he's atoned(by supplying more life for the god of death i.e. - god may not be finished with you Sandor or whatever).

Arya still got to where she had to go as Tywins cupbearer, and we learned more about Tywin. The Bloody Mummers weren't all that important, and basically just filled a ""bad guy"" role. It's when they start doing things that change where characters are going that it starts to ruin things. "

There are few reasons a dog, even an adult or senior dog, can't be trained. If there are issues trying to train a new dog, there could be a variety of issues including something medical related (so an ongoing discussion with your vet would be needed) or it could just be a dog that needs training beyond the owner's capability and knowledge (so a professional trainer would be needed).  

The only reason anyone wants a pure breed or ""designed"" crossbreed boils down to the looks of the dog. Sure, some breeds are more predisposed to have certain personality traits, but it is never a guarantee. If people want to spend their money supporting the overpopulation of dogs and cats in the world, so be it, but don't try to make it sound like purchasing from a breeder is the only way to get a dog without health issues that can be trained properly."

16719,gameofthrones,"The actor playing him seems pretty sure Littlefinger didn't know what Ramsay was like.

Contrary to the way some people act around here , Littlefinger is not all-knowing and all-powerful, and Ramsay was virtually unknown prior to getting legitimized. People may have been aware Roose had a bastard, but even his own liege lords didn't know Ramsay personally...notice Roose always refers to him as ""my bastard"" around Robb and Catelyn and there's never any sign of recognition from them...likewise Theon doesn't know him at all, and he spent nearly his whole life at Winterfell.  If even the Northerners aren't really aware of Ramsay, I think it's VERY safe to say Littlefinger was being honest when he said he didn't know much of anything about him.

Some Northern Lord's random bastard isn't something that's normally going to be on Littlefinger's radar, and by the time he *should* have been on Littlefinger's radar it was too late (and Littlefinger was a little busy arranging the death of Joffrey, Sansa's abduction, etc...). "

Sam then goes on to regrow all the trees that were cut down with the gift of earth he got from Galadriel. Frodo then leaves once everything is fixed and Sam returns home to his wife and daughter. Sam is then elected mayor of the Shire seven consecutive seven year terms. Years later when Sams wife dies he then ends up heading to the undying land himself.

16825,gameofthrones,I read the book after watching the movie  (the movie didn't make me want to read the book but my friend was reading it and told me it was a lot better) and I was so pissed that the movie basically didn't even really try to adapt the book. That book would've had so much potential as a miniseries or something.
16826,gameofthrones,LOL ;)
16827,gameofthrones,I'm guessing this is sarcasm... Right?
16828,gameofthrones,"I think they wanted to satisfy fans with some strong pay-off after seeing him disappear for a few seasons.  I was totally satisfied with it, but I agree that they seem to be moving a bit too quickly.  A total shame since it's losing a lot of its charm, there was so much worldbuilding and nuanced dialogue in the first 3 seasons (I love 4 & it's probably my favorite season but I think it was absolutely at its peak in the very beginning).

16843,gameofthrones,Dude Longmire was an awesome show! That is so cool
16844,gameofthrones,But it also appears to be something GRRM signed off on. I think there are questions that still need to be answered about fire resistance.
16845,gameofthrones,"Amazing! As an amateur art hobbyist myself, I love seeing stuff like this. I also love speculative subjects and you've got a great imagination. 

They all look fantastic, but I especially love the unicorn. It's not just a horse with a narwhal tusk, it looks like a goat horse hybrid and the horn is unique. Nothing magical or fanciful, it looks like something to be found in the real world. 

Just like GoT in general, which is fantasy, but so grounded in gritty realism that the magic and fantasy elements are practically mundane. 

I'm sure there's a market for a ""Exotic Beasts of the World of Fire & Ice"" book if you contacted the right people. 

Again great job! These look like they fell from the pages of a Maester's notebook. "

16854,gameofthrones,"This is all the prequel we need, HBO."
16855,gameofthrones,Maybe but Ned knew he was going up against probably the greatest warrior of all time. Ned was one of he best but compared to Arthur Dayne he was an amature. 
16856,gameofthrones,Haha it took the white walkers 7 seasons to get to the wall. Dont underestimate their lack of speed

16877,gameofthrones,"I really appreciate your sarcasm here. Such a misguided practice!

For anybody reading this, I just wanna say that sexual orientation (I.e. being attracted to either / both / neither gender) and gender identity (being ""effeminate"" or ""masculine""), while often grouped together, can also be totally seperate.

Couldn't have said it better - her character is one of the biggest pillars on which the whole show stands - and Lena is delivering a masterclass performance.

"
16890,gameofthrones,"Except: they're the same size as each other, he's partying thrusts and not two handed hard swings, and the swords are roughly the same length.

Bit different than a child with a tiny sword in one hand deflecting a two handed overhead swing from a giant.

That said, it's a show so whatever and hardly the most unrealistic thing to happen. I don't think it's a big deal."

For me, it's one of the few instances where luck isn't just a bad plot device."
16908,gameofthrones,Why?
16909,gameofthrones,"Who says this? And is it saying that although jaime is amazing, tyrion is like is his dad but jaime is just different, and thats okay.

16940,gameofthrones,"From the trailer it looks like the ravens are flying over the NK and his army of wights, then the NK looks at them and the scene cuts to Bran ""waking up"" from warging. The same sudden awakening happened to Bran when the NK touched his arm during his ""vision"" (that was quite real, because the NK left his mark on him) back in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven.

Anyway it can be only a trick to fuck up with us viewers, the two events happening at different moments/episodes."

16945,gameofthrones,I feel like Theon is going to somehow wind up on the Iron Throne simply because that feels like the kind of middle finger GRRM/HBO likes to throw at people. Classic misdirection.

16976,gameofthrones,"In the books, a skull is sent to Dorne that is too large to be anyone but the Mountain's, and Qyburn takes many people, many corpses, down to where he is working on Gregor. Its not entirely out of the question that, in order to have a huge knight with unwavering devotion to Cersei to have the mentality of one of her children. This is why his face is never seen. They could have just said He's Gregor and no one would have batted a damn eye, but instead kept it in secrecy and called him Robert Strong. He doesn't seem to mind the name either. And given Robert Strong's reactions to conversations happening around him and how he reacts to someone just shit-talking Cersei, it seems weird, yes, but not entirely unfeasible that Joffery's head is indeed mounted on the Mountain. "

16980,gameofthrones,I currently cant remember the episode name but when Snow goes back beyond the wall to try and unite the tribes to get the wildlings to join them. And then the white walkers come just completely destroying and killing every god damn body. And at the end of the episode when there is absolutely ZERO music and the white walkers are just standing there watching Snow and the others float away to their ship. And you see just how insane this situation is turning out to be. That ending scene gave me goosebumps with how the atmosphere was set.
16981,gameofthrones,We need a lip reader!  What is Jon Snow's real first name?  I'll bet it's Aejon. 
16982,gameofthrones,"Since they seriously considered Iwan to play Jon Snow, they must have obviously thought he was capable of playing the role, so I'm sure Iwan would have done a great job as Jon. In regards to Kit, I don't think he would have made a good Ramsay. I don't have any particular problem with his acting, it's just that from what i've seen of him, he hasn't shown much range in his performances, so I don't believe he could have played a convincing Ramsay. That's just my opinion though."

17020,gameofthrones,"He could be legitimized like how Ramsey was. I don't know who would do that though. Cersie isn't about to, and I don't see why Dany would. I guess Jon might, especially since he's been more or less legitimized himself and would probably want a Baratheon on the throne over a Lannister, but I doubt he really cares enough about southern politics unless it means they'll help him in the war against the Night King. 

So yeah. Baratheon line is fucked. "
17021,gameofthrones,She's the best! 
17022,gameofthrones,"I think its completely plausible that the castle would be abandoned, it never occurred to me as an inconsistency when I watched.  Stannis left it empty, we know that for sure from the dialogue. Dragonstone is extremely hard to access from the land (being an island) and has virtually no farmland or city around it. The only theoretical people who might want it while Stannis was away was a large army to make it their fortress. But the country just got out of a civil war. No one from the north would want it and the middle of the country is still recovering from all the fighting / or returning form the siege of Riverun. The armies of the vale left to help secure Winterfell too.


The best option would be that the lannisters took the castle because they predicted Dany might come for it, which Jaime mentions in 7x01. Cersei doesn't have a military mind so she didn't think of occupying dragonstone until it was too late and the conversation where Jaime mentions it was probably a couple days before Dany arrived so she simply beat them there. I mean... the time frame in the show is always hard to accurately pin down and things can happen not in the same instance so yeah its believable that Dany beat the Lannisters to dragonstone IMO"

17026,gameofthrones,"Sansa knew it from the get go, Ramsay wasn't going to let Rickon live, and it makes sense. He was a threat to him and Ramsay doesn't like threats. I hope Sansa got to learn a bit about battle from this one, because she seems to have learned how to play the game well enough, but she needs to know how to command, especially now that she might be the queen of the north."

Even the people who we would traditionally cast as the ""good guys"" have faults (Ned dying for his honor, Rob ruining his alliance, Kat's hatred of Jon Snow, Danny's need to conquer Westeros (basically sentencing thousands to die for her pride and vengeance, Robert wasn't a good king, but he wasn't a cruel king either and she didn't know what a prick Joffrey was )). And the same with the bad guys that we actually get to know. They have some redeeming qualities that make us like them and even side with them (I'm looking at you Hound). "
17058,gameofthrones,"But surprisingly similar to. It's not quite as bad as some of the choreographed dancing with sticks you see in the prequels, but the scene shares a lot of the same problems, just not quite as pronounced. You can see it in one of the overhead clashes. If you follow the momentum through to where it would have gone if it hadn't been blocked, it's clearly aimed somewhere a foot or so above Ned's head. Not a terribly effective way to kill someone."

In s7, dany was slightly taller than Drogon's head, but in the trailer it looks like if dany was standing right next to him, his head would now probably be taller than her.

17173,gameofthrones,How so? The Targaryans lost their rightful claim to the Iron Throne when Robert took it by right of conquest. The fact that no legitimate Baratheons remain in the show doesn't make the claim magically revert to the dynasty that was deposed for good reason. If Jon learned about his heritage he could certainly try to claim the throne for himself but at this point his claim isn't any more righteous than anyone else's because there remains no legitimate heir to the throne.

17175,gameofthrones,"He's thinking that they need every body they can get to hold off the Night King and he's not wrong. She's thinking that having loyal houses in between them and the Night King is important and she's also not wrong. They both had good points, but I think Sansa was right in that Jon was trying to be merciful like their father, but she got to see firsthand how far mercy will get you in Westeros. We'll have to see how it plays out, but it looks like they're both playing the same game, just from different angles."
17176,gameofthrones,"He's not that old. Ser Allisor Thorne was at the Wall because he fought for the Targaryan's in Robert's Rebellion, so that means he's at least as old as Ned, and he was still a ranger.

It's very hard for people who had mothers, that would sacrifice their own lives before their children's lives, to understand the mentality of a mother willing to sacrifice their children before they lost the love of their husband or hurt his ambitions. 

You don't often see mothers betray the future well being of their children for the future well being of their Husband. 

I'll admit my bias, I'm always envious of hearing from friends who's mother's and parents are ""Helicopter parents"" I would have loved to have been cared for that much.

That's just a waste of her arc. 

Arya is also similarly safe, because her training has yet to connect to anything actually going on anywhere else. And Maisie Williams said Arya is doing great this season and ""learns a valuable skill she'll be able to use against people for a long time to come."" "

17252,gameofthrones,"In the show, I suppose, though it wasn't sex with Renly that got him caught it was with Olyvar.  If Renly became King then the Faith Militant/High Sparrow would have never been empowered.

Possibly, it could have screwed them over once they were on the throne though, since it's pretty difficult for two gay guys to make a biological heir.  If he managed to get it up and ""do his duty"" to get a baby on Marge I think he'd have been okay.  Though I could see the ""probably a bastard"" rumors swirl, if Renly claimed them as his own it'd have been accepted I think. "

17281,gameofthrones,WIFE HER UP BEFORE I PISS MESELF!!!!! 
17282,gameofthrones,"Also logically.

Oberyn loved Doran... Why in the hell would Ellaria consider murdering his Brother and his Nephew as the best course of action? Would he honestly have wanted that?

Also Oberyn's death was because he decided to fight for Tyrion. its not like Doran could declare war b/c his brother put himself into harms way and got burnt.

I dnk. I want GoT to be a show where actions and consequences make sense, not simply to drive the plot forward."

17285,gameofthrones,"That scene was much worse. In the book, Drogo seduced her, and they had consensual sex. Why change it? To make Drogo unsympathetic? No, that wasn't their goal, he still supposed to be sympathetic. To make Dany hate him? No, she still falls in love with him. So why? Completely gratuitous and carries the offensive, retrograde implication that women don't really mind being taken by force. 

Ramsay on the other hand is supposed to be an unhinged sadist, and Sansa definitely won't fall in love with him."

17291,gameofthrones,"I admit, I was once an excited 12 year old begging his grandmother to take him to see The Lightning Thief movie because I loved the books. I distinctly remember this movie visit in particular, not just because it was a horrible bastardization of one of my favorite stories, but because while I was enthusiastically explaining some set up for the fantasy world to my grandmother during the previews, an old guy sitting in front of me turned around and threatened to fight me for talking.

In a few months I'll be old enough to have a few drinks and hopefully forget this shitty, shitty film. And near-ass beating via random old man."

By letting him live and convincing him and everyone else that she's going to march her armies north, she gets everyone off her back and away from here. And hopefully (in her view) they get killed in the process and save her the trouble. "
17374,gameofthrones,"I'm terrible.  Just good luck. 
I'm so clumsy and awkward.  
But for sure being left handed helped.  Even if it was always by a second....that's all I needed.   
I'm guessing the people I hit, were expecting to be hit.  Then then they got hit on the other side.  They were also probably expecting a slap...and I did punch....no I'm not good at anything with coordination, but I am lucky and awkward...and when you're mad or scared or whatever...that helps too.

17381,gameofthrones,The grimm writer. 
17382,gameofthrones,A surprise to be sure
17383,gameofthrones,"I've heard this argued both ways over and over again, especially throughout the last week. Logic says he's a bastard. Rhaegar was married to Ellia. Any children he had through Lyanna were bastards. But then there was also 9-12 months that she was with him. It's possible that, as prince, he had them married legally. Obviously there's no evidence directly supporting this right now, but there could be come next season. "
17384,gameofthrones,"My fave is when he goes back to Cersei after the attack and he’s not even changed out of his armor and he’s like “I just saw the Dothraki fight. They’ll beat any mercenary army- they’ll beat any army I’ve ever seen. Killing our men wasn’t war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burnt 1,000 wagons. Qyburn’s scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn’t stop it.. *and she has three of them.*”

I mean it totally puts how powerful she is in perspective. I’m 99% sure I’ve literally never seen Jaime feeling or looking defeated and he is just standing there all but screaming “we are fuuuucked.” He looks like he just wants to throttle her bc she just can’t understand what he’s trying to say and how damaging the Dothraki actually are- then to add DRAGONS on top of it!"

Things are sorted by topic, not by author. Unlike with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and others, the front page algorithm does not give any advantage to users whose posts you've liked in the past.

The site is still very much usable without a login.

That's what makes Reddit special. Everything else is oriented around user identity, and Reddit makes the user almost irrelevant to the interface."
17450,gameofthrones,"I wonder how much Tywin had to do with ""Robert's Rebellion"" also??  He was the Mad King's hand, and had asked for Cersei to be wed to Rhaegar.

He is the one that had the Mountain kill Elia and the children.  I can imagine that he somehow convinced Robert that he HAD to go after Rhaegar for taking ""his"" woman.  "

17487,gameofthrones,"> because Targs weren't exactly the kindest of rulers

There were more good Targaryen rulers than bad ones, the last one (Aerys II) just happened to be exceptionally bad indeed.

> Cersei, at the time of taking Queen as title would have the most direct claim to taking the Usurper's crown.

Cersei has no claim. Widows don't inherit anything in a feudal society, except the lands of their own family if the widow happens to be the daughter of a Lord. The throne falls to the next Baratheon relative. In 300 years of history of House Baratheon, it's next to impossible that all of them are dead.

**I didn't mean to say that Cersei wouldn't have taken the crown, given the chance. She would, and she did. The point I tried to make is that it would be impossible for her to hold it for long, if you look at it logically.** She lacks the military resources to remain Queen. Any Lord Paramount, e.g. Robin Arryn, could easily depose her.

The Lannister armies should logically be depleted after several wars (they aren't in the show, for whatever reasons) and are scattered across multiple parts of the realm, namely the Westerlands, the Riverlands, the Crownlands, and probably the Stormlands too. Any sizable army should be able to crush her. Daenerys Targaryen and the Vale certainly have the military means to. 

She wouldn't have had the crown for long, had the show taken relative military strength into consideration and if it were written accordingly."
17488,gameofthrones,"Does Emilia have short hair that she needs a wig? Or does she do other shows in between?

17548,gameofthrones,"The cool thing about books and stories is they take a life of their own once they leave the creator's head. GRRM gets the final say, but his world has become a separate entity. Take, for example, the concept of Arya as a character. Everyone's internal idea of Arya is gonna be a lil different. We can't know *everything* about Arya so we make assumptions as readers, we get influnced by ideas in the show, and we emphasize and downplay different aspects depending on our own internal thought processes right? So Arya exists as a fictional character with fixed lore and a smart person-designer as a god, and also as a conglameration of a ton of real ideas (different to everyone) that, even if you laid all these ideas out to someone, *they* would see something different still because of how they relate and define all the parts. Not to mention, though GRRM is the decider, even he can't possibly imagine 100% of all of the characters all the time, he can only address issues as they're asked or as they come to him, so for every character (and actually almost every detail) (and also this applies to all authors writing fictional books) there is a massive grey area of ""what would this character think/do in *this* situation?"" or ""what would the rest of the God's Eye look like that GRRM didn't describe?"" Or... well a bunch of other things, where we all get to have our own semi-valid answers or guesses that are all influenced by our personal understandings so we kind of see a bit of each other when we poke at these things and compare

So we're not just discussing storytelling and cool made up worlds here, we're also on a deeper level discussing things like personality traits, definitions of words, worldviews, tactics, even if we're not explicitly saying that (though we totally do sometimes lol) it can't help but be an underlying theme as it relates to the story. And it's all sorts of crazy shit that is filled with totally real meaning and useful to us as humans. THAT totally blows my mind, man

Plus it's fun as hellllll"
17549,gameofthrones,The only time indicators in the show are people referencing how long ago Robert's Rebellion was and Sansa's age and Little Sam' age. Season 1 the rebellion was 17 years ago while in season 4 it was 20. Sansa is 13 in season 1 and 14 in season 3. Little Sam is born in season 3 and looks like he's 2 or 3 in season 7. Yet none of these make it clear how much time has actual passed in the show since each story line isn't happening at the same time as others and there's no reference to which month in the year it is. Sansa could have just turned 13 in season 1 and in season 4 when it's brought up it could have been a few months before her birthday.

The real difference between them is that Ramsay enjoyed sadism for its own sake and acts without regard for any consequences while Cersei enjoys getting whatever she wants at that particular moment and schemes to get it. Her approach doesn't lead to quite as short of a lifespan since she typically has contingency plans for when things inevitably get ruined. With the high sparrow and arming the faith militant she made a huge mistake by not having a backup plan because when she gets so enraged about something she does sometimes throw scheming out the window and takes the easiest option.

17591,gameofthrones,"When you compare her marriage to Ramsay as opposed to Joffrey, she was definitely a more active player with Ramsay. She wasn't in any positions of power, but she was for the first time taking actions with the game in mind. She took a beating but S05 was absolutely the most defining season for her as a character. "

17750,gameofthrones,"You know, in the show canon, it's entirely possible that Dany is heat-proof.  Clearly Viserys wasn't, but Dany probably is. The hot bath isn't the only example. There were also the dragon's eggs she had heated on a fire which she held without harm but when her handmaiden held them it seared her palms.  And last night there was not just the fire, she held the rims of the fire rings right next to the flame without harm.

The one issue I have is how she also seems to be immune to smoke inhalation and charred falling rafters, which have never really been explained.

People raise a big stink about it because they don't like deviation from the books but nothing would have been glaringly wrong with it if it had been so in the books and there's nothing significantly wrong with it being true in the show besides making a bunch of book readers feel a little less superior in their book knowledge."

17769,gameofthrones,Mayhaps
17770,gameofthrones,"Littlefinger's downfall will be Bran. In fact the seeds of it have already been sown. Bran didn't just reveal what he knows of Littlefinger to him; he revealed he has a source of information that can reach from the private halls of the Red Keep to beyond the Wall. In Littlefinger's mind he has to be asking ""How could Varys send the text of their conversation north of the Wall? Was it even Varys? Could there be a third party out there?"" 

The possibilites are unknown and thus what Bran knows is unknown. So unknown that Littlefinger has to assume that Bran knows anything and everything. As Littlefinger told Sansa, you have to imagine every battle possible, and play it out until you have the path to the victory you want. But it's a lot different from imagining the realistic possibilities of King's Landing and the situation he now finds himself in. There are undead enemies that cannot be negotiated with an a young man who is potentially omniscient.

So what can Littlefinger do? His plots are now set up to ignore all these facts. He can't include Bran or the Army of Dead into his plots because he cannot know or control them. It has become a huge blind spot but one he is so aware of it has to trip him up eventually."
17771,gameofthrones,"I think after that prophecy that all her children would die started coming true she eventually thought it was only a matter of time before Tommen died too and hence was prepared for it. 

Also I think she took such drastic measures to kill everyone because by replaced by a younger and more beautiful queen she must've thought it was Margaery. Maybe by killing her and keeping tommen in the red keep she thought she could destroy the prophecy, with her plan to do so being 'saving' tommen and becoming queen. 

Now I think she's just gone crazy because she can and refuses to believe that she could possibly be displaced from her position of power although deep down she knows it's gonna happen but she isn't gonna give a fuck and just mess shit up for the whole of Westeros by throwing a tantrum, unless of course Jaime stabs her.

Today 3rd cousins seems to be the closest socially acceptable relation but  in westeros marriage between great houses isnt the norm except maybe among firstborn. Offspring usually married bannermen who were more likely to have some relation to the ruling clan to tie them more closely. Karstarks were originally the karhold Starks, there are the lannisters of casterly rock and the lesser ones in lannisport all are somewhat related but wouldn't mind marrying off kids to each other."

His parents are pretty damn lucky that they aren't on the front line. 


I hope Jon gets revived and that drogon flies in and takes him away to Essos and Jon's all like ""later, bitches"" because since he technically died so his watch is ended and all that and then he learns the secret of forging Valyrian steel with Kelly C whilst the white walkers are killing the idiot nights watch and that king ice darth maul I forget his name just like gives olly really bad frostbite on his toes.

17920,gameofthrones,Like the mustard?
17921,gameofthrones,"The reason for this is that they were pretty much made to be each other's ideal partners. Here's something I wrote in another thread about this:

---------
Jon and Dany have become each other's ideal partners over the course of their story arcs. For Dany, she worships, romanticizes, and idealizes the known traits of Rhaegar and in fact he's the one person she wishes she could have met more than anyone. Jon is essentially the second coming of Rhaegar not just because he's his son, but because he embodies all those traits along with Ned Stark more than anyone else; in fact he's a greater man than this father and will live to realize his father's potential. Through Jon, Daenaerys will get her Rhaegar.
For Jon, his attraction is to the traits of his strongest formative female bond. Normally this would be his mother (ironically those traits are hers), but since he had no real maternal influence in his life, Arya fulfilled that role for him. So when you look at the type of women he's drawn to, obviously beauty plays a role, but independence, willfulness, competence, strength and authenticity are things that he can't help but be drawn to, and what he treasures; this can be seen in both Yggrite and Val. But what specifically Jon says about Val tells you everything you need to know about what he desires in a partner, and this is after his relationship with Yggrite:
(Jon XI, A Dance With Dragons)
>Val looked the part and rode as if she had been born on horseback. A warrior princess, he decided, not some willowy creature who sits up in a tower, brushing her hair and waiting for some knight to rescue her.



This combined with her beauty and the fact that Jon as a boy idealized and even wanted to be like the great Targaryen legends in which Dany is following in their footsteps makes her his ideal woman.
In other words, they were pretty much made for each other.


---------



I'd like to end as well that it's evident that Jon represents both ""ice and fire"" when you look at his lineage so people tend to write off Dany as if Jon is complete on his own. But this series isn't called ""ice and fire"". If Jon already represents those two, then what is the ""song""? Well, why not look at Daenerys, specifically her name. If you spell her name backwards, it would be ""syrenead"" which is a phonetic way of spelling ""serenade"", meaning a musical composition [I.e: song] , and/or performance, in someone's honor.

Daenerys is the song, Jon the ice and fire."
17922,gameofthrones,Sansa was kind of a bitch for the first two seasons also. I guess it took someone even worse to make her realize that she should be a nicer person.
17923,gameofthrones,No one wants to be forced to lose weight. Even if they should.

From the original charge, to the Bolton phalanx slowly closing in, to the struggle on top of the wall of dead people, to the final charge, it was all perfect. Also shout out to the directors for making the charge of the Vail soldiers realistic. They didn't just charge into the middle, but went around the outside of the semi-circle. Twas dope. 

The only place where it faltered was in the taking of the castle. Jon, Tormund, and giant boy were running after Ramsey way before the fighting even completely finished and the rest of their soldiers could gather themselves to charge at the castle, but somehow once the door is broken down they're all there. But I'm willing to suspend disbelief because that's just TV, and the episode was so good."

17987,gameofthrones,Hopefully without the violent hemorrhage.
17988,gameofthrones,"You’re right, I did. But you know, sleeping beauty is raped and impregnated in the original story and you don’t see that on the children movies either 😉 "
17989,gameofthrones,Like jerry
17990,gameofthrones,"I mean, an army and three dragons are much more powerful when they have someone uniting and leading them... If they have no direction, it becomes easier to whittle them down and eventually defeat them. And yeah, the dragons might kill everyone in sight in the moment, but then they'll probably find some comfortable mountain to live in, and kill locals until some brave soldier/army vanquishes them.

In that moment, where the battle was hopelessly lost, Jaime very quickly realized there was only one thing he could to do disrupt the enemy's plans enough to potentially beat them in the long wrong, and he takes that option right away. Fairly heroic *and* smart, if you ask me. "
17991,gameofthrones,What constitutes a terrible beer in your opinion
17992,gameofthrones,"I think Ned's biggest fault was keeping the secret of the Baratheon kids.

He should have spread it far and wide thus killing him would have not achieved anything,"
17993,gameofthrones,Cool but that horrible filter ruins it.
17994,gameofthrones,"The part you said about Jaime and his hand, the item that has previouslydisappeared reminds me of the fact that he had once loved her so much. And now his faith is wavering, I don't know if we can yet say he is turning to Dany since he hasn't even met her yet. But I wouldn't be surprised if that does end up happening especially since she now has Tyrion"
17995,gameofthrones,His voice is incredible. He could read me a phone book and I'd swoon.
17996,gameofthrones,I am literally from wales and it just spun me out so i've spelled it both ways accross like 5 posts haha
17997,gameofthrones,oh yeah true..
17998,gameofthrones,❤️
17999,gameofthrones,It is known. 
18000,gameofthrones,ELI5: What's a parallel in this context?
18001,gameofthrones,Shh
18002,gameofthrones,"You can shit on him all you want, fact is he was dead before Jon laid eyes on him. You think Ramsey would have allowed him to be rescued? If he'd actually managed to avoid getting hit long enough, Ramsey would just have called on his archers to blanket the entire area to ensure the death. Not to mention that zig zags would have slowed him down, pulling Jon even closer to Ramsey's line.

There was no right play for Rickon. He was dead no matter what he did."
18003,gameofthrones,"She's my favourite character of the show, and most people just don't understand because they hate her so much. It's a crime she didn't get an Emmy for seasons 5 or 6.

It's not that she's not a villain. It's that she's unabashedly a villain and doesn't give a fuck, but more importantly that she has had one of if the the best character arcs and progressions on the show, and she's very well rounded and complex as they've fleshed her out in last few seasons. That's rare for a villain in any show, and even rare for a villain on Game of Thrones.

Honestly I cheered when she blew up the sept last season. It was just so badass and I had no idea it was coming. For me it's up there in the top three moments of the show ever, along with Ned Stark's death and the Red Wedding. I am happy they didn't make her go the route of the Mad Queen going bonkers to mirror the Targaryen king, though I do wish they'd given her more juicy scenes this season. Still, the actress did a great job with the meat she was given, and one of my biggest fears was that they'd have her die as the 'big death' of this season, so I can now breathe a big sigh of relief that she's in that rarefied company of characters who have been on and made it alive to every season of this show.

And I still *LOVE* that she stole being the first queen of Westeros from Daenerys. Love love love it."
18004,gameofthrones,"I watch GoT with a small group of people. Mainly my brother, my gf and me with the random friend here or there. The house rule is that we keep our cups full and no one talks during the episode. My brother brought his (now ex) gf for the viper vs mountain episode and she couldn't keep her phone down (if you dont care about the show, fine, im not going to bitch about that) or her mouth shut. He had watched up to this point with her, but now I realized why it was a struggle. She had no idea what was going on and asked every 1.5 minutes what was happening, and she had no genuine show that she cared what was going on in the first place. If you dont like the show thats 100% ok, but don't lie about it."
18005,gameofthrones,So my post gets taken down of this scene when my two year old gets anxiety from it but this one is cool.Lame ass MODS.
18006,gameofthrones,I cant believe I have to wait until 2019 for a new season wtf am I meant to do this summer. 
18007,gameofthrones,Really good.  Littlefinger especially is fantastic.
18008,gameofthrones,"Looks awesome, I just find it funny considering Dany's storyline is probably the least kid friendly of all the storylines"
18009,gameofthrones,Awesome! Thank you so much and great work! 
18010,gameofthrones,He is the kite wolf
18011,gameofthrones,The Blackwater flag should have a giant cockroach on it.
18012,gameofthrones,"Davos used to be a smuggler, sometimes smuggling onions. Stannis took him in, but punished him first by cutting off his fingers, which is a common punishment for thieves and smugglers. Stannis knighted him, hence the Onion Knight.

Here's more: http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Davos_Seaworth"
18013,gameofthrones,I would say Hodor is sick of holding stuff though
18014,gameofthrones,prophecies dont fulfill themselves
18015,gameofthrones,Hahahahaha I guess I'd just give a wink lol
18016,gameofthrones,Yeah...  Hannibal season 4.... :-(
18017,gameofthrones,If only I had that kind of free time
18018,gameofthrones,Olenna's got the best kill list too for me. Not one death satisfied me more than Joffrey's. Not even Ramsay's nor Olly's.
18019,gameofthrones,"Bronn has among the highest kill counts, solely because he immolated Stannis' fleets at the Battle of the Blackwater."
18020,gameofthrones,Both absolute r/madlads 
18021,gameofthrones,Well... *technically* he *was* dead.
18022,gameofthrones,"Oof that one hit me really hard as well, the worst part in that show for me though was when Jax found Tara's body, Charlie Hunam's acting and the song that was playing just hit me so damn hard"
18023,gameofthrones,"Oh, but it IS a game! You said it yourself!"
18024,gameofthrones,"You will need to clarify then because you said, ""there have been many references to Jon staying a virgin and then being careful with Ygritte because he never wanted to father a bastard"" this implies youre saying he never had sex so wouldnt have any bastards. If I am wrong in the interpretation can you explain what you meant better?"
18025,gameofthrones,Id pay the iron price for the bottom left corner
18026,gameofthrones,Running in and out of every brothel and pub in Volantis frantically searching for Tyrion.
18027,gameofthrones,I read a good theory that passing the dagger was each Stark rejecting little finger. Bran passed the dagger to arya who passed the dagger to Sansa. All that's left is Sansa to kill little finger with the dagger. Then arya can wear his face and be in a position of power
18028,gameofthrones,"I don't think so. George mentioned requiring Dragonfire and most likely requires magic in order to retain it's edge like Valyrian Steel does. I imagine there has to have been one Targaryen who brought Blackfyre or Dark Sister to Oldtown to figure out how to make more, which is what I would've done."
18029,gameofthrones,Planetos
18030,gameofthrones,Thank you 
18031,gameofthrones,"They did burn him though, right after he died too. And then the fighting started."
18032,gameofthrones,"You said it was ""hilarious"". I found it mildly amusing. I got the joke but fail to see how it qualifies as hilarious. "
18033,gameofthrones,Ice Maul
18034,gameofthrones,Yeah the time travel bullshit is the worst written and least compelling part of the show for me. 
18035,gameofthrones,Oh man I'm sorry to hear that. Stay strong fellow freefolk.
